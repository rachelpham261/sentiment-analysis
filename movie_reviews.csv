3.5,"A movie that is carried by its two charismatic leads, and Idris Elba as well.",0
3.5,"If your an action person this is for you. Pure adrenaline rush. From it's opening action sequence to it's physics breaking finale Hobbs and Shaw is a summer blockbuster at it's finest. The Rock is great no matter what and here he gets to punch plenty of dudes and look awesome doing it, wheras Mr. Statham gets to take some dudes out with agility and speed. I loved the back and forth banter between them as the film progressed and you can tell they really started to bond. As for the women boy do they get to shine , Vanessa kirby kicks ass and not just one but plenty , she holds her own against the muscles. Eiza once again sidelined but it's great to see her in a blockbuster again. It be great if wb casts as her catwoman. Idris Elba does what he does best just takes names and looks great doing it , while I wasn't a huge fan of his arc i'm still glad they went with it no matter how insane it was. Overall Hobbs and Shaw go check it out if you want to see non stop action for two hours , it goes by in a breeze.",0

4.0,"Even from a series that's known to go over the top, this movies goes well beyond that.

5.0,We can't wait until the next one!,1

4.0,I like the action and the comic relief. But the CG stuff went a little too far.,1
1.5,"This was an attempted spinoff of the Original Fast Movies. This did not have the intensity of the Originals. Seriously, Black Superman. This was a way for Johnson and Statham to continue their careers, by being Producers. The action was so Bruce Lee with neither actor showing injuries or being tired from the fights.

2.5,I liked seeing the Rock. I strongly disliked the extra audio that played with every action scene. Nothing like extra loud kicks or punches. It was predictable. I actually fell asleep üòû,-1
5.0,It was very good. They did justice to all three actors (included Edris) even though they only played up to two in the trailer. Let‚Äôs not forget the females were good too.,1

5.0,"This might be THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE! is it ridiculous? yes. Is it juvenile? ofcourse but none of that matters because above all this movie is fun. All the jokes land, all the action movie tropes are perfect. everything about this movie is awesome. You even get to see Roman Reigns speer someone. perfect movie.",1
5.0,It's a good movie. Worth watching.,1
4.0,"Loved most of the action...love love the stars...Edris, Dwayne and Jason all very good actors..they were the best part of the movie even tho my guy Edris was a bad guy.

4.0,"This was a good action movie, with great visual effects. I like that the bad guy had the best weapons, which is unexpected. The only drawback was that some of the lines were a bit cheesy.",1
5.0,"It was exactly as we expected. Lots of action and interaction between the characters. Hobbs and Shaw are opposites and compete in the film. The final action seen was a bit too much over the top with the special effects and unbelievable in my elderly opinion. I guess I like movies that have car chases, for example, using real cars performing amazing feats like in the action film Bullet. However, my wife loved the effects. It was really a lot of fun and we pigged out on popcorn too. We noticed there was lots of fighting and shooting as expected but no actual gore which was not needed. We will watch it again.",1

4.0,Lots of action but not a race car movie. Plot was OK. I really like Duane Johnson which is the main reason I went. Ryan Reynolds' cameo was too funny. You have to stay till the VERY end of the movie. They do like three extra scenes. Wait for the lights to dim up. We were the only ones left in the theater who saw the second and third clips.,1
5.0,It was awesome and more than we expected and might go see it again!,1

2.0,"The story was a remake from a Mission Impossible store and was drawn out WAY to long. The directing was bad as there were WAY to many ""moments"" with close up face shots of Dwayne and during the climax scene, while hanging and speeding on the back of a tow truck, decides to take a moment and put his tee shirt on??? With regards to Jason, he has this British cockney accent that is just painful to hear and unfortunately he was speaking all the time. The highlight of the movie was Idrus. He never disappoints no matter what the role he plays. To sum up, the actions scenes were great but to few. The dialogue was to long and the technicals were all over the place. If I had read this review before going, I'd have waited for the video.",-1
2.0,I would have actually liked this movie if they didn't WAY over do the ridiculously impossible driving and fantasy special effects. In real life everyone in the movie would have died 20 + times.,-1

5.0,Action packed!! I loved it.,1
4.0,The only difference between this and Fast 9(The worst movie on earth) is that John Cena gets to have fun and Jason Momoa is eating up the screen. And it's much better for it!,1
4.0,very good movie very entertaining!,1
5.0,"Ngl I was afraid this would suck and was a little over the Fast & Furious franchise, but after this movie I'm def excited for the next one!",1
1.5,"Man this franchise is a joke - the first two, hell even Tokyo Drift were the only 3 truly about racing and cars. Everything after turned to drugs - grudges - family drama - guns and ridiculous unbelievable stunts that were never apart of the series before and now are the new normal over the years lol. Movies could've been so good but people are so use to this hollywood garbage that they think it's actually ""good entertainment."" This movie is really only worth watching if you already invested a lot into the franchise, if its on T.V. or a very cheap rental lol. 3.5/10",-1
3.0,Jason Momoa's character is the only thing that kept me entertained. I don't know why I keep coming back to watch these unrealistic stunts I guess I'm trying to see it to the end.,0
4.5,Jason Mamoa was a welcome refreshing perfect villain. The action scenes are always what we come for but Jason had us rooting for the Villian at times.,1

4.5,great but has a part 2 to follow..,1
3.0,"Villain is a combination of the Joker and Luther from Batman. Tiring character. Typical fun ride. Unfortunately, a terrible cliff-hanger ending. Calling the movie a Part 1 would have given a heads up instead of a disappointment.",0

5.0,I don't like the ending part,1
5.0,All of the EXCITEMENT!!!!!,1

5.0,Very action packed....storyline good...but ending a mystery,1
4.0,"As a franchise fan, it didn't disappoint! I really enjoyed it, lots of action scenes and typical comedy relief. It had us laughing and at the edge of our seats. This time, we appreciated that it wasn't 'emotional' like other Blockbuster films that are out at the moment. It was just fun.",1

4.0,Didnt like the cliffhanger at the end of movie,1
5.0,Yes I despised the character Dante but dang Jason Mamoa did a great job and was exciting to see! Love the Fast movies,1
3.0,It was one of my least favorite of the franchise the villain was weird and too much comedy involved,0
4.0,"People act like this is supposed to be a life changing movie. They're all the same. Just a good action movie with a some humor that gets better with every movie. Jason Momoa is fantastic. He looked like he had a blast playing this character. The cliff hanger was a bummer but given the ending, hopefully we see the next release sooner than this one to be released.",1
5.0,Amazing but I hate cliffhangers,1
2.0,"Meh, didn't hit the F&F spot",-1
5.0,What a way to end it leaving us wanting more!,1
4.5,From beginning to end this movie was exceptional.,1
4.5,I am an action junkie. I loved the fact that all the characters came back. All the cliffhangers for Part 2 especially the ending. It's great family entertainment. I'm excited about The Rock- Dwayne Johnsin but sad about Paul Walker.,1
3.0,Didn't like the ending,0
5.0,I really enjoyed this movie. Jason Momoa was exceptional!,1
5.0,It wasnt as bad as people made it out to be.. it had a lot of action and family scenes.,1

5.0,Jason momoa outfits slayed,1
1.0,"Didnt like acting, very bad. Not sure what happened to Stratham and the team after plane went down.",-1
2.0,"While the cast seems to be having fun and there's definitely some nice fan service throughout, it's a pretty familiar road and proof that only Justin Lin can make these movies work. Here's to hoping this franchise crosses the finish line ASAP.",-1
5.0,Momoa was terrific. Funny in a deeply psychotic manner.,1
5.0,A great action movie3,1
5.0,Love the Fast and Furious movies always have and always will!! But how do you not show if the uncle and kid make it or not? Now I'm going to be itching for Fast 11,1
5.0,The special effects were phenomenal! It is a must see in the theater not at home.,1
4.0,"If you enjoy the franchise, then you'll love this. Nonsensical over-the-top action and all the elements that keep us coming back. Mamoa steals the show a bit...and I'll deduct a star for re-writing the ending which (no spoilers here) makes some of the earlier film plot make even less sense than usual. Still happily looking forward to FastX Part 2 (or whatever they'll call it, lol).",1
5.0,Wonderful entertainment. 10 out of 10.,1
2.0,i think its time to stop making sequels.. thought this one would be different... boy was i Wrong!!! i will not waste my money anymore on this film... might as well turn this film into superhero marvel movie... ü•∫üò¢,-1
5.0,Non stop action....can't wait for part II,1
4.0,good start to summer films. if you like the fast franchise then you will enjoy it. the end left me with too many questions..i am guessing there will be another.,1
4.5,Excellent movie. Stay for the credits.,1
4.0,Really enjoyed the action sequences from beginning to end...unbelievable but fun to watch. Didn't disappoint.,1
5.0,It‚Äôs really amazing.I would recommend this movie,1
1.5,"Boring, repetitive, unimaginative",-1
5.0,"Lots of great action, one of the best movies.",1
5.0,"Fast X was such a cinematic delight. I really enjoyed seeing this cast work together again as a team, their loyalty to one another is evident. The strong bonds in this movie are refreshing and relatable. Friends that become family that you would do anything to protect. They all truly outdid themselves killing the endless fast action packed, heart racing moments. Although the scene where Dom whom I still love drives off a highway and somehow still survives and drives off is too far fetched just not believable in my opinion. Now lets talk about the amazing ladies, whom were so badass in this movie, especially in the fight scenes so refreshing to see women in such heroic roles. OMG newcomer to the fast and Furious series, Jason Momoa killed it in his role as Dante Reyes. I loved every single moment so much he unpredictable and unhinged yet still made me laugh so much made me love the villain more than the heroes in this movie. Fast X is by far my favorite of this series definitely a must see fans.",1
5.0,We loved the movie just as expected.,1
4.0,"Lots of action, fast pace overall good movie",1
5.0,Enjoyed all the action and banter.,1
2.0,"I don't know about this one. Imo, it was bad. Jason Momoa was not good with all the super extra theatrics that was not needed. Within 5 minutes that the movie wasn't going to go good and end bad. üòï",-1
5.0,"Loved it. I was speechless at the end. The action was awesome, the story was intriguing and consistently engaging.",1
2.5,Wasn‚Äôt like the old ones,-1
2.0,"It was like watching a Marvel movie mixed with zombies (Return on the leaving dead), The Joker and mission impossible. Why not watch all at the same time.",-1
3.0,"very little comedy, the little comedy it did have was very korny.",0
5.0,Honestly ever Fast and Furious movie has had a very positive and ending that can lead to family always coming back together. Not sure if their will be one or two more but the cliff hanger ending creates so much about what could be next. I can‚Äôt wait to see what happens next.,1
3.0,"I definitely cringed a few times, but the movie wasn‚Äôt for my enjoyment, it was for my dad. My dad loves action and even if it‚Äôs dumb he‚Äôll enjoy it. So, personally 3, but it kept my dad happy and entertained so in that aspect 4",0
3.5,"It's a lot of action, I just didn't like how the movie ended.",0
3.5,It was definitely Extreme on action. It jumped around making it a little confusing. It had everyone in it. It Totally left you hanging in many parts.,0
5.0,"I thought the movie was 10/10 honestly!! And i was not expecting it to be that good. But i had to see it because of Jason Mamoa and he did not disappoint. I wasnt expecting that from his character, but he was hilarious and played crazy really well. Story line and plot was similar to previous movies, but it was still good. Action scenes were great. I feel like this is one of the best Fast and Furious movies out of all of them.",1
5.0,Awesome loved all the action,1
3.5,It‚Äôs a ‚ÄúFast‚Äù movie. The entire basis is cars‚Ä¶explosions‚Ä¶.guns‚Ä¶.aircraft‚Ä¶.A list stars‚Ä¶. It was ultimately entertaining for my son and I. But the sequels just keep going and going and going. Worthy of nostalgic entertainment value.,0
3.5,The theater was clean and nice the location was awesome as well. What I didn't like was the servers bringing food on the middle othe movie and blocking your view of the screen. I think there should be another way of doing this.,0
3.0,Jason Momona's character was too dark and just sick. Most of the comic relief was too dark. It was action packed from beginning to end. I do want to see what happens in the next movie.,0
5.0,By far the best franchise ever been fan of it since day 1 I will always be a fan ride or die,1
5.0,Great action sequences! The Dante character is well played by J. Momoa.,1
3.5,It gets kinda outrageous but it's the fast and the furious.,0
3.0,story line and end there wasn't one not the same caliper as previous fast movies,0
4.5,Action movie of the month. There is so much going on with this movie and still staying with the main focus of this thrilling movie. I might go watch it again.,1
1.0,unfortunately the movie theater was extremely hot & the popcorn was stale.,-1

5.0,"How? How does The F&F Franchise keep putting out epic films that spawn decades? The characters, the growth, the family. Just love it!",1
5.0,"As always, Vin Diesel and the other regulars made the action wonderful, there were many of the connections to the earlier movies in the series, some of which were hilarious and others thought provoking. Can't wait to see the next one...sorry that it is to be the last one.",1
5.0,Movie need to be 3 hours long. Loved it!,1
1.0,To be honest it was the worst of the series of Fast and Furious. Ir so unrealistic that it was hard to sit for the 2 1/2 hrs of the movie. I was truly disappointed in this movie,-1
5.0,Loved the movie and all the actions and the love for family.,1
5.0,"a good balance between action, comedy and cars. Jason Momoa was the perfect choice and plays the role exceptionally",1
4.0,Good storyline and fast paced as usual.,1
5.0,"Fast and furious and exciting! Such and awesome cast, incredible stunts and Love the faith and family thread running through it. Need more movies like this!",1
4.0,"I wish The Rock was in this film other than the scene after the credits. spoiler alert I would also like to know how Giselle survived. Overall this movie is in alignment with all of the others: intense action scenes of impossible acts, peppered with some comedic relief. If you dont like the F&F franchise, you wont like this one. I love all of the movies so much and this one met my expectations.",1
5.0,Nothing love it love it! My heart was racing like I was in the movie lol intense,1
3.0,I have seen all of the Fast & Furious movies. This one was the most unbelievable and portions of it didn't make sense to me. It looked as though they went back and pulled in all of their menesis but where was the Rock?,0

2.0,"This franchise has nothing left. Nada nothing. Its all pointless and been there done that. This supposedly last film didnt need to be split in two, but I hope the next one is definitely the last one. Watching this you could tell even the characters are bored",-1

5.0,Suspenseful and not gory.,1
5.0,Loved it. Momoa talks too much. Like in all his roles except for GOT. Loved seeing everyone again. Cannot wait for yhe next installment.,1
2.0,Honestly don‚Äôt know where to start in terms of story telling but let‚Äôs just say it drags‚Ä¶ for what‚Äôs to say it feels like everyone just trying to have there own saga verse what ever‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs laughs here and there and I would say the steal of the show is Jason‚Äôs character everything else felt pushed n mixed all together to make it make sense. In my opinion ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,-1
1.0,The writing was sophomoric and the acting was poor. The scene where the two woman protagonists had four minutes before they are found in the prison so they fight was completely lame.,-1

4.0,"Enjoyed it! If your going into any of the F&F movies expecting real-life driving scenarios grounded in reality, them your an idiot! If you watch it for what it is, summer movie that's FX heavy mindless fun. If u are in that mindset then the movie is entertaining fun!",1

3.0,"This movie would have been great had Jason Momoa's role would have been more serious and making everything out of a joke! That annoyed me through the whole movie! Raymond Reigns the wrestler would have been ideal for Herman Reyes son. Otherwise, this would have been a very good movie!",0
3.5,"Despite the not so great reception this has gotten, I think it‚Äôs a fun movie and better than it‚Äôs predecessor F9. Jason Momoa was over the top, but a great villain. There are some wild and pretty amazing action sequences.",0

5.0,I liked how it brought everyone back except Brian. It was full of action can't wait for the next one.,1
4.0,Action and on your seat cliff hanger Far as shot them up action films go a true to fashion man movie,1
4.5,"The movie was amazing. Jammed pack action throughout every scene. It had intense twists and turns that left you guessing. They included so many amazing surprises I wasnt ready for and alliances I couldnt have ever predicted. Not to mention the villain they chose, he is certifiably wacko but perfect for this series. Roller coaster ride of emotions and amazement and I loved every moment. Family for life and I cant wait to see Fast 11.",1
5.0,"My initial thought, this needs to be the last Fast movie. But after seeing Fast X, I changed my mind. My opinion Jason Momoa saved this sequel. Fast needed a new super villain who is in some way connected to the story time line. Fast X did a perfect job creating that for Dante. The only thing I would take back from the movie is a little detail of Hans hair style is long and not short when he met Shaw again in the post ending credit. Overall, the mood and creative direction of Jasons ( Im DanteIm Shante) performance made this sequel fresh and enjoyable!",1

5.0,Action packed Cliff hanger!!! I loved it!!!!,1
5.0,"Jason Momoa was unexpectedly great with his Heath Ledger joker vibes, and Vin Diesel's son stole the show. I was pleasantly surprised. This might be my favorite F&F thus far...and that fight scene with Michelle Rodriguez and Charlize Theron.",1

5.0,One of the best they've done the second part Will be great,1
3.0,It was over the top In some of the action scenes. Not at the top of the Fast n Furious series. I thought this would be the final one but the ending doesn't dictate that premise .,0

5.0,"GREAT ACTION love ALL the characters. ""FAMILIA""",1
5.0,I cant wait to the next one.,1
4.5,"With this being the tenth movie I think we all knew what to expect. Toretto pulling off the impossible in, you guessed it, a dodge charger. We did get the iconic drag race but it was short lived. Although it‚Äôs not about the racing, let‚Äôs be honest it never was, this one will leave you feeling even older than you did when you started it. You‚Äôll realize how far you can get in a twenty year saga and still be glued to your seat wanting another twenty more.",1
4.0,Dante is the best villain in the Fast Franchise! Who will survive from the team to take him on? Can‚Äôt wait for the completion of the fast saga.,1
5.0,Really cool movie experience. The Villian was bad ass.. he was ahead of Dom every step of the way. He was twisted just like the Joker in a way. Can't wait to see the next movie. üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•,1
2.5,If you like watching every FAMILY member resurrect and fight the corniest villain (that makes Steven Segal look like Denzel Washington) of all time. This is the movie for you,-1
4.0,I did not like the ending.,1
2.5,The movie bounces around too much and at times didn't make any sense. The actions scenes were too off the wall to be even possible. If you are bored and have nothing else to do then go and watch. But if there is a better movie playing go see that one.,-1
4.0,Solid movie better than F8&9,1
5.0,"Wow, really enjoyed this movie! Definitely need more Jason Momoa in this kind of psycho villian role! The car scenes were great !",1
5.0,"great as usual, action packed",1
3.0,Always the same ending Inconclusive Action good as always,0
4.0,"It's good, definitely worth watching. If you liked the others you will like this one",1
2.0,"The story is very tired now. The plot is as disjointed as a contortionist. Back and forth like 5 different movies. The CGI is overkill...IT NEVER STOPS! I must be the only one that thinks you need a story with a beginning, a middle, and a end.",-1
5.0,Loved the action - can't wait for the next release.,1
5.0,I loved it and can't wait for the next one,1
5.0,The movie was so awesome! I was going to pass until I saw all of the positive consumer reviews! Definitely one of my favorite since Fast 5. They really took time to reconnect with each character which is why I love the franchise so much since Fast 5. They veered from that in 9 but recovered big time in this one which still had many eye-popping stunts and cool effects but the story went much deeper. I loved it and highly recommend it!,1
5.0,Awesome can't wait for the next one.,1
5.0,A lot of action and laughter,1
5.0,Action packed and awesome,1

4.0,"Sino hubiese sido por la actuacin de Jason Momoa , la pelcula hubiese sido el primer gran desastre de la franquicia. Las persecuciones fueron exageradamente largas.,",1
5.0,"When I watch any movie from this series I turn into a little kid again. Action movies are always pow and bam and wow. The Fast series has turned into something bigger than it originally was. Now it‚Äôs so ridiculous with explosions and defying stunts in addition to the cool vroom of every car in the movie. Ridiculous in the good way. The movie was sooo entertaining. Dante had to be my favorite character, he was so flamboyantly unhinged and playful in his villain that I lit up every time he was on the screen. Okay thanks bye.",1
3.5,I love fast and furious but I don‚Äôt like waiting üòú,0
5.0,"Great movie, always our family favorite",1

1.0,"I purchased tickets with a PROMO code from Fandango for Saturday and after I paid for it, it came up as Today. They won't change the date for me. Upset with customer service",-1
5.0,Thought it was great. Love all the action. That never gets old.,1
1.0,"DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS. Poorly written, horrible acting, stupid stunts. You would get more entertainment watching people at Walmart. Pathetic, I hope the next ones get cancelled.",-1
5.0,Jason Momoa was awesomely crazy!,1
4.0,Action packed with thrilling excitement. All about family and the importance of staying true to the ones you love and care about.,1

4.0,"excellent movie buy, the ending was weird",1
4.5,Great action movie I don't think I blinked for the whole 2 1/2 hours. The ending has left us waiting for the next edition to see who survived the last deadly threat. Don't want to spoil it for you!,1
5.0,We liked the show. It was an action packed movie,1
5.0,omg just what I Loved Action packed can't wait for second part,1
3.0,Jason Momoas character is great,0
1.0,The movie lacked real story line. Entire movie was CGI car chasing scenes with multiple explosion scenes that were overdone. The forced comedic lines were overly cheesy.,-1

5.0,It was awesome as usual.,1
5.0,This was an excellent movie the action was awesome and the ending is very interesting. Must see.,1
3.0,Loved it but wish they had not made Jason Mamoa seem gay.,0
1.0,"for the love of all that is good and holy, this movie was bad. here's the thing, I dont expect much from the fast franchise. the story has been bad since 6, but this movie wasn't even enjoyable. they completely ignored any continuity from this same movie for a quick forced joke or gasp moment. and they're still trying to make the series make sense, and I don't even get how they think it's possible. I look for the good in movies. Even if it's not some deep story, it can still be enjoyable. but this movie wasn't even that, even thinking of it like a fast and the furious movie. there were so many times I legit thought they used the movements of the transformers ride in universal studios in the movie with just a cgi car. like u know this series doesn't like to think of physics, but this was an extreme version even compared to the rest of the movies. and the action wasn't even that good. my girl's brother fell asleep like halfway through. this is gonna be my only SPOILER!!! obviously, I wasn't a fan, but I didn't straight up hate this movie until it ended on a cliffhanger. two more specifically, but they really want a sequel??? why??? this movie was LONG, and they still want a second part. this has got to stop. especially since Vin diesel says its for the late Paul walker. pretty sure he guilt tripped the rock into coming back for these movies using his name.",-1
2.0,"I love the concept and story Line, but the movie is too dark for Kids to see whats going on, the picture Was not that good lots of dark scenes the fighting scene in the end where Ursula Became so big, I cant see the face/facial expressions and the acting on both Prince Eric and Little mermaid is just so so, even the young version of Ursula. I gotta say Mcartney did a good acting wise. The character was not as detailed as the original movie. Plain and bare. Overall 2 stars only. Not so good for me",-1
5.0,Solid movie overall. The new villain really brings it together in a great way.,1
4.0,"Good movie, but really had you questioning what really happen too everyone. Leaving it open for a Fast 11 movie lol",1

4.0,definitely an excellent movie much better than the last movie and definitely looking forward to the end to see who all made it,1

4.0,"The action and effects were good, although some parts looked a bit too fake. For a 2.5 hour long movie, I was expecting a good ending. But this movie sort of left you hanging. But I dont regret watching it. Now Im waiting on the next one to come out.",1

3.0,I love f&f movies this one is too much. the entire thing requires you to ignore obvious logistical issues and impossibilities.,0

3.0,The ending was horrible and not much racing,0

5.0,"Fun for whole family, thrilling, and very action-packed",1
5.0,It was worth watching to see all the well-know actors and actress of the FF franchise. Very interesting plot and the end was something phenominal. For sure there is FF 11 coming out sometime..,1
3.5,"Great action movie. It has all the ingredients. The Fast and Furious story ended with Furious 7. Everything from F8 and onward have been good to great action movies but aren't related to the essence of what we loved about the movies. This one was very entertaining though, despite not be needed for, or related to, the core story.",0
5.0,FREAKIN AWESOME!!!!!!! Never a dull moment,1
5.0,The Fast franchise NEVER disappoints. It was an incredible roller-coaster ride. Jason Momoa definitely gave it a new angle. You'll know what I mean when you see it. What a great Saturday night. Just go see it. You'll be glad you did. Enjoy.,1

3.0,The movie has good special effects. The script is poorly written. The screen writers are awful at Hollywood. Hollywood movies are bad. I enjoyed watching the fast and furious movies when they came out . Please fix the movies. Get somebody who can write a screenplay.,0
4.0,"it was captivating, intertaining. I'm looking forward to the sequel",1
1.0,"Jason Momoa was the single best thing about this movie. Vin Diesel could could barely keep his own eyes open for most of the movie. Simple script, big explosions and minimal clothing. Great for international audiences.",-1
3.0,"Jason Momoa stole the show. You could tell he was having fun with that role. The rest was as over the top as usual, with vehicles that laugh at the laws of physics. It was heavily action packed and you won't be bored. The perfect movie to shut your brain off with.",0
3.5,"A.It's very digital. The scenes you could see that they were digitally enhanced. B.Jason Mamoa's character reminded me of The Joker in Batman. Little quirky, the odd personality of evil. Well done by Mamoa. I do think he should had been listed higher up of actors. Regardless of a posted statement, I read, saying Mamoa ""overacted"", he played it like i believe it was scripted, like Jim Carrey also plays the quirky odd characters. C. There are many drama parts in this movie. You have to keep track of who and where the characters are going. D. There were emotional sections of remembrance. E. As a Grandma, I believe 8yr olds could see this with parents. No vulgarity or nudity was overwhelming. F. Stay after the credits. There's the hint of whats next. G. I strongly advise, before seeing, have an overload movie night/weekend of all the FF series, in order because this one includes them in some way and you might get lost. (B1- I'm just a little prejudice for Mr. Momoa as I'm a Norwalkian of Iowa. So, Ill buy the dvd for that reason.) Enjoy this flick and don't forget the popcorn before it starts.",0
4.0,"Loved the craziness of Jason Manias character. Disliked the character of Charlize Theron, cannot make a friend out of someone who killed your babys mother.",1
5.0,"Loved Fast X. This movie was action-packed from the beginning to the end. There was so many twists and turns, that I didn't know what was going to happen next and to whom. It was a long one, but you were engaged and on the edge the entire time. Stay to the very end, there is more after the credits.",1
5.0,Plenty of action and suspense. There will be an XI,1
3.0,It's never ending... we are on number 10 and obviously there will be another the way they ended it with no closure.,0
4.5,a lot of wild car seens,1
3.0,Too much killing and crashes that appeared fake as the Charger could never survive the crashes and still be drivable. Would not recommend.,0
3.0,Movie jumps from too many places,0
1.0,Story was all over the place. The ending was horrible and characters were only introduced for the hype this is definitely the worst movie yet and I was such a F&F fan,-1
1.0,Sucks !! I want my refund. They should have stopped this series I mean these movies when Paul died. I regret every dollar I paid for it. Never again. They are lost without My Paul.,-1
5.0,"very cheesy as any fast and furious movie would be, the storyline is what keeps me hooked!",1
5.0,"I loved this movie. I AM A FAN OF JASON MAMOA, so I really enjoyed watching this movie! I never get tired of all the action.",1
5.0,Great story as always. Jason Momoa is truly a badass villain in this one! It was a love and hate ending.... But looking forward to the next one!,1
3.0,These are getting too far out there. I get the fast-paced and racing high-speed scenes. there were several that were completely unbelievable... I definitely liked the others better.,0
1.0,Repeat of every other one,-1

5.0,Fabulous. have gone to see it 3 times!!,1
3.0,Some guy snuck in and kept watching us,0
2.5,This movie franchise is now for milking in at this point. Let‚Äôs just stop going to see these movies so they‚Äôll stop.,-1
3.5,"Too many unbelievable action scenes and the new ""bad guy"" was too creepy and flamboyant for me. I also didn't care for the choice of who lives and who dies at the end. I am a big fan of the Fast series, especially with Paul Walker, but this final episode left me disappointed.",0
3.5,"The family dynamic is what I like most. Of course the action is exciting. Its pretty far fetched, more so than other Furious movies.",0
3.5,Movie had a lot of different locations in the movie. A little hard to follow.,0
5.0,DID NOT SEE THAT COMING! Absolutely hilarious and catch worthy! Can‚Äôt wait for the next one!,1
0.5,"For a large budget movie cgi was terrible, it was supposed to end with 10 movies because that‚Äôs what was promised with Paul Walker, making this a trilogy is just milking it at this point",-1
5.0,It was an awesome movie!! Lots of unexpected but that is what makes the movie!!! Loved it!!!,1
5.0,"This is one of the better movies in the Fast and Furious franchise. The movie looks like money too! The locations, the cars- oh and the overall style! The stylist for the actors need an Oscar nod. The storyline is perfectly set up too. Definitely a must see!",1
1.0,"Muy mala no tena ni pies ni cabeza, se les acabaron las ideas",-1
3.5,"Fun, entertaining, action packed, doesnt take itself too seriously.",0
5.0,I liked the action and how Jason Momoa did his role.,1
1.0,disliked that i couldn‚Äôt make an exchange of my tickets 30 min before showtime because of not being to come to my original time due to family emergency.,-1
3.0,"Lots of car action like you've come to expect and decent humor, but I'm starting to feel like the story has gone on for too long now. Jason Momoa looked like he was having fun with his role, and there were other additions to the cast that I liked. The ending is enough for me to come back for the next one.",0
5.0,Was a great movie but felt like I paid for a half a movie,1
5.0,Unbelievable action awesome driving and just a good story line and stay for a while after the movie is over you won't believe what is coming next. It is a surprise and i never thought what is coming next will be unbelievable,1
3.0,The movie was so unrealistic. The only thing that kept me watching was Jason Momoas' character.,0
5.0,Love it can't wait to see where it take us next,1
0.5,Jason Momoa ruined it,-1
2.0,"Momoa looks like he's having fun, but I only wish I did. Overall mediocre with bad CGI and story, but at least not boring. This franchise needs to end...",-1
5.0,The surprises! The geographical content! The end. Nail biting and two thumbs up. This is definitely a must see.,1
1.0,"Felt like I was watching a video game, way to much CGI action.",-1
5.0,Need another one with Hobbs and Vin Diesel if he still alive,1
4.0,Cliffhanger?! Seriously?!,1
4.5,It was pretty good now I‚Äôm sad. I have to wait for the second part. When is it gonna come out?,1
1.5,Movie was ok. Would‚Äôve waited till it hit Netflix. Aquaman just literally sucked. Remove him. The ending also sucked,-1
4.0,movie plot was not that good but Jason Mmoa made the movie he never swears yet still makes the movie worth it to watch but the ending is a cliff hanger,1
3.0,"The whole movie was okay, but the thing that a hated the most was the cliffhanger and the end. I hope fast 11 comes soon, I do not want to see another cliffhanger",0
0.5,The whole movie was not what I expected,-1
5.0,Esta pel√≠cula esta con madres!!,1
5.0,This movie keep getting better and better. Great movie,1
5.0,"Really good movie! Jason Momoa is one of the best bad guys ever. There should be a spin off series of just his character. I would watch 10 movies of that, too!",1
5.0,Surprisingly entertaining,1
5.0,I don‚Äôt like the ending because now I‚Äôm wandering what‚Äôs going to happen. But overall I love the movie.,1
4.0,"Great action, great surprises....Jason Momoa was hilarious and insanely chaotic as the new villain. The team is going to put in all the stops to handle this fool cuz he did something that no villain has done: Left the movie on a cliffhanger!! Hyped to see how it all ends!! Family is forever!!",1
5.0,"Special effects were excellent!! Nice to see Little Brian grown up. Lots of action, sprinkled with some humor. A good summer blockbuster film!!!",1
5.0,Action filled with a surprise ending!,1
5.0,It was entertaining and surprising.,1
5.0,The movie was very nice and a lot of action if you like action movies its worth the money,1
3.0,"It's an ok movie. Lots of action, but too much jumping all over with the many different characters and plots, and only one of them came together at the end. The only bright spot ... Jason Momoa's character makes the movie. This series is getting farther and farther away from its origins, sad cause it could be so much better.",0
1.0,"Jason Momoa's character is a mix of The Joker and a modern version of Capt. Jack Sparrow. But I did like the concept of going after each ""family member"" and not world domination (hence the one star). Each movie must have an ending, we know its a 3 part movie but don't end the movie with an explosion then roll credits. If you have no intensions of killing off Toretto's ""family"" then there is no reason to make this a 3 part movie!",-1
5.0,great movie definitely worth the money to see it,1
4.0,I love the cars and the places we travel through the movie .,1
5.0,Amazing fast series never disappoints me or my family with the action the cars everything was amazing,1
2.0,As much as I love the actors I can't give good review. This movie is a set up for another sequil. Ending was not an end. Lots of unrealistic stunts. I think a 13 year old may appreciate. But we were bored.,-1
5.0,"Its was pack with lots of emotion , Awesome actors",1
5.0,One of my favorite Fast X! Cant wait to see part 2.,1
1.5,done with these movies ü•¥üëé,-1

4.5,Can't wait for the next,1
5.0,it was good got mixed reviews before watching it tho,1
4.0,High action and thriller scenes. The villain is awesome!,1
2.0,"Continuity errors, bad plot, bad dialog and crazy stupid action sequences. Still worth the price of a ticket for Momoa as Dante. He's officially my favorite villain of the franchise! I hear there are two more movies coming and I hope he's the Big Bad in both of them before they eventually kill him.",-1
1.0,If I could give lower I would,-1
5.0,Full throttle action throughout the entire movie!,1
5.0,This storyline always leaves you wanting more. The 10th version does not disappoint. Buckle up buttercup it‚Äôs going to be an exciting ride.,1
4.0,I love all fast and furious movies including this one. There was a lot going on in this movie and it seem Dom finally met his match! Upset with how it left me hanging but I can‚Äôt wait for the part 2! Great movie.,1
5.0,never thought this movie will be really good. a lot of action,1
5.0,"Always entertaining even when the stunts are super ridiculous. Love al the history and new people. Mamoa's character is hard to hate. flamboyant, funny and great accessories. excited for more.",1
2.5,The ending didn‚Äôt make any sense and it didn‚Äôt had a happy ending,-1

3.5,Hate that its a two parter! But good story up till then.,0
5.0,It was intense and comic at times that make it more real.,1
4.0,"As usual, the action was non-stop almost from the very beginning of the movie. Enjoyed it a lot, The only thing I was disappointed about was how they ended the movies.",1
2.0,I will make this simple this was a very dumb movie but if want to laugh go see this. Outside of that the only reason to pay for a ticket is Jason Momoa's performance. Enjoy!,-1
5.0,"nonstop, you üòâ wink and you missed it. Must see!",1
4.0,Realistically the cars should have fell apart so many times. The villain was too over the top (esp. compared to his previous role as Aquaman)! There were two cliffhangers. And it appears there's no ending to the series of movies.,1
5.0,That movie was fantastic. Just waiting on part 2!!!!,1
5.0,You have to be open minded as this is an action movie with almost impossible scenarios and if you get that out of the way it is truly and amazing story!!,1
5.0,it was awesome üëå üëè üòé,1
3.0,Kinda just the same as all the other movies in this series except new cars and a twist on things towards the end as the movie progressed I got the feeling I was watching the joker because the villain in the movie had the same characteristics as him jokes around as he killed here hurt people. Biggest disappointment was the ending,0
1.0,"the only star is for Jason Mamoa!!!! the rest, please go home",-1
3.0,Hated the no ending. They wanted to include every previous actor and their appearances felt like add Ons. All actors seemed to act like they are tired of the series and the story line. Production was fantastic as alway.,0
4.0,Still love the car and the characters they play. Love the imagination and how that shows up in the theatrics.,1
5.0,Lots of action and heart! Highly Recommend!,1
4.5,It was honestly great,1
4.0,Great movie but that ending confused me.,1
5.0,lots of action surprised by all the stars that were in the movie lots of surprises. Quirky end though but over all loved the movie. might be one of my favorites,1
0.5,such a horrible movie. üò´,-1
4.0,Jason Momoa killed it!!!,1
4.0,"I loved seeing all the favorite characters return, but they didn‚Äôt interact enough for me. I usually love all the stunts, but this movie has a lot. It may be just a little too much. The movie is fast paced and absolutely keeps your attention. The villain is more like the riddle from DC comic movies.",1
3.0,I didn't like the way the movie ended,0
5.0,Great action and suspense!,1
5.0,"A great movie. The plot, the actionunreal!",1
1.5,Jason Momoa character doesn‚Äôt match him at all.,-1
4.0,Typical Fast and Furious movie but still entertaining can‚Äôt wait to see Fast XI,1
4.0,"I liked this one much better than the last one. Mamoa's character was a flamboyant cartoon character, but he got the job done.",1
5.0,"Excellent ending, excellent send off for the team, nicely done",1
3.5,best dum action you can only get with these movies,0
5.0,"Good movie, lots of action..!!!!",1
5.0,"Amazing. Great movie, the Villain Jason Momoa as Dante was so funny. Reminds me of Joker. Can't wait for Pt.2, also stay after credits.",1
4.0,it was fast paced and exciting.,1
2.5,"I like the action I thought this was the last one so I was disappointed at the ending. but I read that there's already and 11th one being made. also I came to see Jason momoa but was disappointed in his character, I felt they made it try to fit in with the whole woke thing going on. if I had paid more than 10$for this movie I would of be mad.",-1
5.0,It was definitely action packed filled with twist and turns but at times it got a little tiring watching Jason Momoa behave and act like the joker! I was hoping he would snap out of it and be the badass villain with a professional attitude thats a combo of the Equalizer and 007 but due to over confidence would eventually get what he deserves a Jokers ending,1
5.0,Absolute loved it!! The suspense was mind blowing! Cant wait for the next one,1
4.0,"I like that the team had to rely on ol' fashioned smarts, grit, and brawn in this one. Jason Momoa was a nice touch, but it seemed he was a tad over the top. Perhaps you needed an over the top villain for Dom and his team! Looking forward to the next installment with BIG hopes for a Dante-Hobbs showdown!!!",1
1.0,The unrealistic stuff is getting old. Storyline had potential but the ridiculous stunts etc made it stupid.,-1
4.0,Great movie. Too much animation. Nice story so many loose endings.,1
4.5,It was so much fun and made all these connections to past movies in the series.,1
4.0,Very entertaining and pleasantly surprised. Hubby and I liked it!,1
4.0,"Definitely not the best and is very much a part 1 to either a duology or trilogy. The family is back together and slowly being torn apart! Jason Momoa shines as the eccentric villain, one who needs a few surprise returnees to the franchise to help slow down his rage. Looking forward to Fast 11, long live fast cars and freedom!",1
5.0,It had lots of action! The car chases were crazy! And I love the way they mixed in all the emotions with the action,1
3.5,"Momoa is a great addition. Ending was not great, left unfinished for sure (that was not a cliffhanger)",0
5.0,I loved the action & suspenseful ending.,1
5.0,"I loved the all the car crashes and action in the movie. I really didn't like the ending, it left me with too many questions",1
3.0,2+ hours of explosions and improbable driving. A good escape but excessive as well.,0
3.5,It was a typical Fast and Furious movie with lots of action and far fetched moves. But I think it is well worth seeing on the big screen to get the full effect. I would definitely recommend it.,0
5.0,The Fast Saga Fast X is the best movie that you will ever watch. My sons and I have watched all of them from the beginning.,1
5.0,Tons of action and humor. Ten times better than what I expected.,1
4.5,"One of the best movies in the franchise, Jason Mamoa is one of a kind actor",1
5.0,"there was nothing i disliked, fast moving and left you wanting more and what happened to some of the characters.",1
5.0,"Exciting great movie, cant wait for the next .",1
3.0,"The movie was exciting in the beginning and then it got stale in the middle. By the time the son was kidnapped, it ended abruptly and we found out there are 2 more movies for this franchise. It needs to be action all the time and less character build up because it has too many characters",0
5.0,Its just fun! Just plain fun. Nothing else to it. Nothing else needed. Fun!,1
5.0,Fantastic movie experience,1
3.0,"I didn't like it, I think the first movies it was better",0
5.0,Movie was fire!!! Great message on family over everything!!,1
5.0,Movie is pretty good and the new addition of this villain is probably the best. Excited for the next parts. Looks like there‚Äôs gonna be a part 2 and 3,1
5.0,I loved it. It was great. Brought back a lot if old characters. Jason Momoa was also funny,1
5.0,Myself and my son found the movie very entertaining! Was bummed the way it ended but I get it and will see the next!,1
4.0,was good but two parts are a bit annoying,1
5.0,Like all from beginning to end . Can‚Äôt wait for the other 3 parts coming up,1
4.0,Vin Diesel and Jason Momoa do not disappoint in this movie!,1
1.5,"Way too much it never stops. You could say it‚Äôs entertaining but it‚Äôs so long, far fetched, and convoluted, it becomes boarder line insulting. Doesn‚Äôt even leave you with the cliff hanger it leaves you with an answered nothingness.",-1
1.0,So bad. Jason Mamoa‚Äôs character and acting was the only thing good about this corny and predictable film. Waste of time and money.,-1
4.5,"more car scenes, typical ridiculous stunts that we've come to love from Fast movies. excellent cast and non stop surprises. great movie all around",1
3.5,"I‚Äôm excited for the next one just as anyone else, but can they stop killing off characters then miraculously resurrect them.",0
3.5,"Good flick. Lots of crazy unrealistic stunts. It was exactly what we expected, but with more open of an ending than we would have liked if this is to be the last of the main crews movies.",0
5.0,I loved the story line and was great to see everyone and the newbies on the show .,1
5.0,"Really enjoyed it, so happy to see so many faces..just mad it ended üò†üòî",1
3.0,Special effects and fight scenes are good but story line is questionable.,0
5.0,Wild fun ride ! ALL HEROS DON‚ÄôT FLY THEY DRIVE CARS !!,1
5.0,Action pack. The movie delivered 2+ hours of excitement. Jason Mamoa was an awesome villain.,1
4.5,The movie was very action packed. Many surprises. Never a dull moment. Like it a lot.,1
3.0,I‚Äôm sorry I just think sometimes I don‚Äôt care how many billions it may be time to let this whole franchise retire. Jason Momoa I just couldn‚Äôt take seriously as a villain and the movie ending basically made me feel anger.,0
4.0,Lots of action and twist to the movie. You must stay until the lights in theater comes on.,1
4.0,I liked the creative action. Passionate moments were lacking emotions and feelings.,1
4.0,It was what was expected. Lots of action and top actors.,1
3.0,The lizard villain was dark and very creepy for a childrens movie. Hoping my kids dont have nightmares.,0
4.0,Online purchase was a little confusing.,1
5.0,Super funny!!! Great family movie.,1
5.0,My daughter(9) and I thought it was a great movie.,1
0.5,Son unos metirosos compre tikets para ver la pel√≠cula de panda 4 dec√≠an que la funci√≥n era en 3 D pero sali√≥ ser regular la pel√≠cula lamentablemente AMC me dice que ellos no tienen control de lo que ustedes publican no comprare mas boletos desde su plataforma,-1

3.5,Not as funny or exciting as the prequels.,0
0.5,Wasn‚Äôt able to go. Got into a car accident,-1
0.5,Way too loud . Theater comfortable. Just really no story lots of ridiculous fighting. My 5 year old grandson wanted to leave,-1
1.0,Let's stop opening doors to the spirit world. Especially in kids movies.,-1
5.0,Great in all aspects,1
5.0,I very much liked the experience and service.,1
5.0,"So funny, great amount if time before children start getting wiggly, great mommy and kiddo dates",1
4.5,Good plot still funny to watch the great dragon warrior kick butt üî•,1
4.0,Predictable but a very good movie in general!,1
5.0,It was really funny don‚Äôt know what it is getting all this hate,1
5.0,Kung Fu Panda never misses i don't care what anybody says! Nobody kicks ass and makes you laugh like my man Po. The main villain was raw and vicious. I wish they had his kung fu pals join in on the action but alas this movie is a great watch solo or with the family,1
5.0,"I like the story. End of a journey, here comes the start of a new one.",1
3.0,Not as good of script Dialogue. Almost too predictable.,0
4.5,"I loved how at the end all the movies come together in one for the finale. Without spoiling the movie, it wraps up with harmony where it can end there or even continue until Pos next task in life.",1
4.5,It was a good watch felt like it needed more actual Kung Fu to show more of the dragon warrior's skill and less yapping about both the chameleon and the Fox being too small and not being looked at with potential. The final fight felt kinda lacking.,1
5.0,Pretty entertaining movie.,1
4.0,"It had some real funny lines, good storyline, I just missed the rest of the gang",1
5.0,It was so funny üòÇüòÇüòÇ,1

5.0,Super cute and very well done!!,1
5.0,It was so good! Hopefully there will be a Kung Fu Panda 5!!!!,1
5.0,Food was good and the seats were comfortable. And plenty of leg room.,1
3.0,"Ok... here we go. The movie BY FAR was nowheres near bad, ALTHOUGH it lacked a lot in many different departments. First off, everything was rushed. The main problem that kinda sparked the other problems was the movie just being rushed. The fight scene towards the end, the beginning, the intro to the crooks of Juniper City, and many more instances. The second problem was NO MASTER OOGWAY!!! Granite, that is a personal matter and I figured he wouldn't return but STILL. I also believe they could have AT LEAST shown the actual Furious Five once during the actual film. And no, the cardboard cutouts don't count. I did enjoy watching the character development of Zhen throughout the film, although I'm not sure she deserves to be the main character in a non-confirmed Kung Fu Panda 5. In his own way(as he does throughout all of the films), Po's character development is again perfect. My patience was also heavily tested by the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema lacking to ever bring out my meal. Not fun... Anyways, movie wasn't horrible, probably won't see it again until it comes out onto DVD.",0
4.0,"really enjoyed it - it's a fun franchise. not sure if i've seen the others. tons of good jokes, cute dialog, and plenty of action.",1

4.0,Good movie to add to the franchise. Love how they tie in the previous villains,1
4.0,Was pretty good I think it ended the series well but the end felt a little weird with all the villains leaving I think it would‚Äôve been cool if Po and Zhen fought all of them and sent them back,1
5.0,Really good and really really funny like always,1
4.5,Well done! Loved it.,1
5.0,It's a fine movie and a good end to the franchise. I would gladly recommend this film to my friends and family to see. I can't wait to own this on blu-ray.,1

2.5,"It was a good movie to spend time with my kid. Some decent jokes here and there dont really think a fourth movie was necessary, but it was good enough to pass the time.",-1
3.0,My granddaughter really liked itway too much dialogue for me and too dark I liked the scenes that were outdoors!,0
1.0,Too much violence very loud desentizes children to similar events in the real world. Will not attend another showing even though good triumphs over events l,-1

5.0,"Its was great seeing the movie, kids learned great lessons",1
4.5,"My sister and I watched Kung Fu Pand 1 to 3, and we loved Kung Fu Panda 4 as well! Looking forward to seeing Kung Fu Panda 5 soon!!",1
4.0,"A nice family movie which had a few touching points. However, I thought it could have built a little more on chameleon's background. Overall it was a nice film to watch with the kiddos.",1
3.0,"jack and aqwafina weren't as funny as they could have been. writers kept them tied to a pretty mid script. i'm a little tired of the ""handing the legacy down to a plucky new tough girl"" plot device. could have been better. they really tried to make the dads seem like a couple - a dis to adoptive families who might have enjoyed a shout-out. best part of the movie was seeing tai lung again and tenacious d's end credits song. still love jack and aqwafina, but the filmmakers wasted their talents bigtime.",0
2.0,"It's enjoyable, but this one falls short compared to the past three movies. They made the chameleon character so powerful then when it came to the fight scene it was disappointing.",-1
4.0,No Kung Fu Panda will be as great as Kung Fu Panda 3 but this one was good. We saw it in 3D and I have to say it wasn't as good as Migration in 3D so you could probably skip the 3D version.,1
3.0,The visuals were very good. The story and comedy were lower than previous movies.,0
3.5,The chameleon was not properly developed. I missed the furious 5 in the movie. Not the same,0
5.0,I have seen all of the Kung Fu Panda movies. This one did not disappoint. Good family movie.,1
5.0,"My family and I had seen the previous 3 and was hoping the 4th would not be a disappointment. It was not!!! We thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. Great nuggets of wisdom, good storyline and and hearty laughs to have. What more could you ask for in a cartoon movie.",1
5.0,The movie was really good and it does give a great ending to Po's Dragon Warrior status and to still be able to continue the story of they chose to.,1
5.0,"Adventure, humor, colorful, teaches lessond.",1
4.0,"Cute, feels a bit like they reused the movie plot with the peacock",1
5.0,"This was a very cute movie with a wonderful storyline and the children really enjoyed all the humor, action and lesson learned at the end! I will highly recommend watching this movie with the family!",1
3.0,"#KungFuPanda4 somewhat succeeds by having cool, action packed fight scenes, awesome character moments, and amazing references to past things, but ultimately fails to capture the essence of the #KungFuPanda franchise itself.  It's bogged down by bad pacing, wonky editing, and its antagonist is the weakest of the four. The beginning drags on and on, while the ending gets better, but in the end, it just doesn't work.  It's okay for what it was. Like #JackBlack is great as Po, #IanMcShane is phenomenal as Tai Lung, and some other characters get their time to shine, but that doesn't save the movie.  3/5",0
4.5,Super cute movie my son loved it,1
5.0,"Watched it with my family, and we all loved it. Great addition to the growing family of masters. I do hope they keep the party going with another addition, especially as the story seems like it has new legs.",1

5.0,it was very good and funny,1
4.0,Cute movie for young children.,1
1.0,"Predictable, unfunny, visually overwhelming.",-1
3.0,It wasn‚Äôt the worst animated movie ever made but it was set the old rinse and repeat recipe that we all have seen before. I doubt they will make anymore of the franchise after this one. 3/5 - An honest review,0
3.5,The first movie set the highest expectation of comedy and we expect more comedy. Movie is still very good though,0
5.0,As an adult I truly enjoyed the movie üëåüèæüòÖ,1
5.0,My 9 year old really lied it. He said he liked the twists and surprise appearances.,1

5.0,"Loved the story and the banter, not disappointed in any way and truly enjoyed the movie.",1
3.5,"The animation was great, storyline was good, it has it's funny moments and the action sequence were pretty cool. I recommend this movie for pre-teens and parents. Great family movie.",0
3.5,Family really enjoyed it.,0
3.0,"Certainly not as good as its predecessors, but it was okay. Many jokes were predictable making it less funny and it just didn't seem to have as much heart as previous series installments. Missed having the Furious Five, especially Tigress.",0
3.5,"Not nearly as good as One, or Two... but wow this movie just didn't ""hit"" like 3 did! What a bummer imo! But in the end all that matter is that the kiddo loved it. 3.5/5 for me, lackluster story and very generic - even for a kid movie.",0
5.0,"Great sequel, great story, no complaints!",1
4.0,Nice cartoon. A bit similar scenario to the previous ones.,1
4.5,"Funny, great story. The whole family loved it. Weve watched it twice already!",1

4.0,Full of action and it keeps the kids interested!!!,1
2.5,The movie was blurry,-1
5.0,The animation was great! Plenty of action with a good storyline.,1
4.5,My grandchildren gave it a 9.5 out of 10. It is full of action and has a sweet moral to the story about perseverance and team work.,1
4.0,"It‚Äôs a good movie because it has consequences unlike some sequels. I loved it and it‚Äôs honesty and humor,",1
5.0,Enjoyed watching Kung Fu Panda with my Grandson!,1
0.5,Awful for kids. Dark and scary,-1

5.0,One of the greatest movies ever made. Surpassed all expectations with its valuable lessons for kids and profound wisdom.,1
4.0,Excellent family movie.. great to see in 3D,1
5.0,It was a great funny adventures movie,1
1.0,"For a movie that was suppose to be child friendly, there sure was a lot of darkness and sorcery. The coarse joking wasn't funny to the point some children may think it is good to do bad things and delve into demonic activity. My wife and I were not big fans at all. There should never be seeds of evil planted into children through movies. Yes, evil may exist and that needs to be evident but to make light of that evil is a wicked evil in and of itself.",-1
4.5,Action packed with good life lessons,1
4.0,"Somewhat violent, too much fighting. Bit scary",1
4.5,"I'm t was a fun, positive movie and my granddaughter loved it. All actors are epic",1
4.5,Went to see it with my 13 and 14 year old. They loved it. I gave it a 4.5 because I asked both of them how was it- my 13 year old said 5. My 14 year old said he really liked it but thought there were others better.,1
5.0,Loved it. Fun. Ending was a little tame but everything else was fantastic.,1
5.0,I took my grand kids they loved it! I really enjoyed it and the humor was great,1
3.0,"So to be clear, I did enjoy this movie. However, there was little to no story and it wasn't compelling in any way. It was mostly a reuse of the previous movies, with heavy emphasis on Poe's ""Dad's"" and his new sidekick. I liked that his father's came to his aid but it was haphazard and overdone. Po's new sidekick ""Zhen"" was very bland and the voiceover lacked any real talent or emotion. Viola Davis, James Hong, and Ian McShane did an outstanding job in their roles. The ""Furious Five"" were also conspicuously missing from the movie, once again removing any compelling reason to see the film.",0
2.5,Looked good but felt forced and had plenty of story problems and the message was obstructed by the plot and the meh humor.,-1
3.0,"This seemed to move a little slow until about halfway. Not as good as previous versions, but entertaining.",0
5.0,Awesome! Just as good as all the others. Definitely worth seeing theaters. Will own and add to collection.,1
3.5,"While I did enjoy it, I think it‚Äôs time to end this franchise on a high note. Family will have a blast and the 1 hour and 30 minute time limit is perfect.",0
5.0,It was light and funny. Just the thing for senior citizens to relax to. Only problem is the volume in the theater. It is too loud.,1
3.5,Very informative about reptilians,0
4.0,Good pace the secondary plot was distracting from the main plot,1
5.0,"Lots of laughs, good for kids and adults!",1
4.0,Better than I was expecting,1
5.0,Best of the Kung Fu Panda series visuallysome parts almost psychedelic. Funny and goes great with popcorn.,1
5.0,It's a cute funny family movie for all ages.,1
1.0,It was so dark and scary that my 6 year old told me that We shouldnt have watched this one he had nightmares and I agree it was way too dark and shouldve had more jokes It was the worst movie of them all,-1
4.0,Always entertaining... unbelievable visuals.,1
4.0,"some plot made no sense, how did carmeleon get Po's kung fu moves without sucking his spirit?",1
5.0,It had a good story. We enjoyed it very much. It was well done.,1
1.0,"plot jumps too fast, villian isn't attractive opposed to previous villains such as Tai lung, and didn't have enough money to hire voice actors for major character but had one for Scott",-1
5.0,"The message at the end of the movie,",1
5.0,Fun Movie for the family!,1
3.5,"My K- daughter liked it, although some nuances went over her head.",0
5.0,"It was funny, kids enjoyed it.",1
5.0,another great Kung Fu panda movie!,1
4.0,Good silly fun in the spirit of the previous movies (no pun intended). Some good laughs and probably the end of the series as we know it.,1
4.5,very good. Enjoyed it very much,1
2.5,"A little boring in the beginning, but got better during the fight scenes. this was not the best Kung Fu Panda movie",-1

5.0,I thought it raked up with the others. Great movie and entertaining! Our kids were really into it!,1

4.5,Great movie and great characters and good conflict,1
3.5,My granddaughter and wife watch it. They enjoyed it.,0
3.5,"The movie had a lot of action but it started off somewhat boring. It was funny but the first one still tops all of them. Overall, it was interesting.",0
3.5,We thought it would have been better to bring the original cast of characters back at the end. We were not fond of the villains either.,0
5.0,Fun movie to watch lots of action,1
5.0,"Just like the others,,, fantastic!! Cant wait to whats next!! Love all the actors, Aquafina added that special touch!!",1
5.0,Kids loved it. A lot of never ending action,1
4.0,Very cute and fun movie. Wonderful for the younger audience.,1
5.0,the theater was empty so we could yap,1
5.0,Great family movie. Our kids loved it,1
2.5,"It was decent, an interesting plot and new characters with a few funny lines, but it felt more like a free short than a major motion picture.",-1
5.0,we really enjoyed the movie,1
4.0,Can wait until it hits streaming. Cool to just get out the house with the younger children.,1
5.0,Outstanding movie kept my attention,1
4.5,"""Kung Fu Panda 4 is a hit with Kids! It's packed with great morals, lessons, and humor that kept my son entertained throughout. """,1
0.5,The movie was good. The movie theater was horrible. The food was horrible.,-1
5.0,"Adorable movie. My 8 year old loved it It was our first Panda movie we've ever seen. We may watch the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd now.",1
4.0,"Movie was very self-aware, and was able to accurately reference all the previous installments in a very fun way. The problem was, it may have been too self-aware, and not courageous enough to take a chance. It followed the same formula of Poe, needing to learn a life lesson in order to advance, but this life lesson felt small compared to the other movies. Also, the quick dismissal of the furious five in the very beginning lacked that kung fu panda dynamic of him being a more advanced master, but them being more crisp and skilled at the basics. It was still fun, and I‚Äôm happy I saw it, but can‚Äôt call it anything special. That being said, I definitely felt the same way about the previous two installments, and it took a rewatch to realize how deep they were. So maybe there‚Äôs some hidden meaning in this one as well that I just did not catch.",1
5.0,Awesome humor and plenty of action. And as always it had a feel good moral to end the story!,1
3.0,Pretty good. Great animation and for being the 4th movie in the series its not bad.,0
5.0,I love the action n kid friendly,1
3.0,"It was great for the kids, a bit stale for the adults.",0
1.0,"He didnt have his old friends , we missed them a lot",-1
4.0,"Great movie for the kids. Plot was easy to follow, animation and actors were great. My 6 year old loved it. On the downside, theater audio was heavily biased to the left side. Right side was almost inaudible. I'm sure it would have been more immersive with better audio, but my little one didn't notice so I wasn't going to waste time getting the issue solved while missing the content.",1
5.0,It was a really fun movie!,1
4.0,Overall a solid animated film. The Chameleon was the best part Viola Davis did a wonderful job voicing the character and the animation around The Chameleon's transformations were captivating. Mr. Ping and Li Shan (Hong and Cranston respectively) were endearing as supporting characters.,1
3.5,"Simple, enjoyable, energetic, and entertaining.",0
5.0,Great movie! We had so much fun!,1
5.0,I loved the emotions it made me feel. It was very funny and the action kept me entertained. It was forsure one of my top favorites.!,1

5.0,Was a great movie! You should definitely take your kids to see it! :) but I‚Äôll say the plot was a bit short but the fight scenes was immaculate. Overall the movie is a 5/5 but without the Furious Five it could‚Äôve been better.,1
5.0,Love this movie and I like this more than the 3rd Kung Fu Panda! While I like that backstory this is action packed and well put together!,1

5.0,My granddaughter enjoyed the movie so much.,1
5.0,"First of all, I absolutely loved Kung Fu Panda 4. Had some good characters and was much like the first 3 films in the franchise but there were some new characters, like The Chameleon (Viola Davis) and Zhen (Awkwafina). Overall, I thought Kung Fu Panda 4 brought out Jack Black‚Äôs character as Po. Hopefully, this is not the end of the Kung Fu Panda franchise. 10 out of 10. It was that AWESOME!",1
5.0,"Great continuation of a fun series that has been around a while, introducing new characters into the world felt very honest and not pushed. I hope there is another movie to continue the story in this new direction and life of Poe.",1

5.0,Beautiful film. Po is the best,1

3.0,The movie reflected all the other ones,0
3.0,"This movie is hard to stay interested in. Starts slow, then picks up, slows down again and finally holds your interest towards the end. I took 8 and 11 year old boys and they both wanted to leave half way through. We didnt leave but I was seriously thinking about it.",0

3.0,"Not as good as the others, but still entertaining.",0
2.5,"The animation was fine, the action was pretty fun, even though not as fun as the other films, and it can be funny at times but in the end, the story and jokes were mostly mediocre, the villain was uninteresting and Zhen was pretty annoying. Overall, not bad, but its easily the worst of the series.",-1
3.0,"Loved Aquafina as Zhen, my favorite character in the movie",0
3.0,It had a lot of violence in it. The children with me 11-15 enjoyed it more than I did.,0
4.0,It was a fun movie from beginning to end.,1
4.0,"This latest installment in the Kung Fu Panda series was a delightful surprise! The story was fresh and engaging, packed with action and humor that kept my son glued to the screen.

5.0,Well written and fun.,1
5.0,"Just what our 6 and 4 year old grandsons like: fighting, boy humor, and the good guys winning. It was too loud for the 4 year old.",1
3.5,Great story of redemption! Classic Po with the added comic relief of his adoptive dad and biological dad. The plot seemed fast-paced the villain's motives were too quickly revealed. More emphasis was focused on Po's and his successor's internal struggles.,0
5.0,Excellent animation. Story builds on previous Kung Fu Panda movies,1
5.0,Enjoyable addition to the Kung Fu Panda franchise - with some great quick-witted jokes!,1
5.0,"A sequel to a great trilogy, I wasn't sure what to expect... but they did it! Another hit for Kung fu Panda! All-around fun movie that carries the story further of the Dragon Warrior in his journey.",1
2.5,My child was bored about half way through. 7 years old and was more excited about going to McDonalds afterwards. The 3 D didnt even seem like we were watching 3D.

5.0,"cute movie, entertaining, appealed to the kids, in sync with the other movie sequels",1
5.0,Good family friendly movie,1
4.0,"Awkwafina's Zhen is the star of the movie, her backstory and personal journey are definitely the focus. Her comedic chemistry with Po is so much fun! The Chameleon isn't as one note as the trailer suggests in many ways she's the Anti-Po. But of course this is Kung Fu Panda and Po is still the heart of the series!! Not the best in the franchise but considering how Great these movies are that's not a detractor.",1
4.0,"I liked the theme, humor and music of this movie!",1
3.5,Took three grandsons to see this they liked it a lot I thought it was good.,0
3.0,Kung Fu Panda 4... not the best of the franchise but a solid film in the franchise. Good for some laughs and good fights. Negatives... The story isn't the best of the franchise. The big risk and threat wasn't the best. The villain story isn't the strongest and a little weak. No Furious 5 on the film!!! Mixed... I feel like the film could have been a little long like the past film. Positives... the new Character Zhen played by Awkwafina is a good new character and got a Sly cooper vibe to her. Jack Black still awesome as Po and never fails to make me laugh and feel for him. His 2 dad's still are the heart and some good laughs. Shifu still funny at moments and great advice. The Fight scenes still look amazing. To Sum up Kung-fu panda 4. It's not the best film in the franchise but it's a solid film in the franchise. I recommend that it be a streaming series. It's not terrible just a ok film. I liked it ok. I recommend it to Kung-fu panda fans but if your a casual fan. I recommend Streaming it. I give Kung-fu panda 4 3.5/5 OK funny time.,0
4.5,"Cute, goofy movie pretty good for a fourth installment in the series",1
4.5,My daughter and I liked the movie. Love the way it ended. We liked it better than KFP 2 and 3,1
5.0,Great message behind the movie,1
4.0,The villain was lacking a bit but good movie overall!,1
4.0,Panama is at it again with the hilarious fight sequences and the antics of KFP.,1
5.0,My son and I loved it. We are ready for Kung fu panda 5! We can relate to the panda. We try to find inner peace but constantly thinking about dinner please! üòú,1
5.0,Granddaughter loved it!!!,1
2.5,I wasnt as funny as the first movie. It needed more action. It was missing the furious five! Shifu was missing also.,-1
5.0,Fun exciting and suspenseful. Jack Black was awesome.,1
1.0,This was supposed to be a good movie for me and my boyfriends anniversary. We loved all the other movies before this so we had high hopes. The first hour of the movie dragged by with nothing new nothing interesting. It was all the same stuff. I feel like because of today society this movie put less effort into the movie and more effort into trying to please all the Karens. I wish I could get a refund for this. And I wish they would make movies like they used to.,-1
4.0,Entertaining like the previous episodes but his nemesis was defeated too easily this time.,1
3.5,"Honestly, there was nothing particularly special about this, and it was missing some of the cast from the other movies too. There were plenty chuckles here and there, but the story just wasn't that interesting and I found myself drifting off and losing focus on the movie at times. Definitely felt like it was missing something compared to the others.",0
0.5,"Weakest Kung Fu Panda movie in the entire series by far. While the other films were genuine works of art with expertly written character arcs and well paced scenes, this one is just too lazy to even try and way too fast paced like it was made for the kids of the TikTok generation who cant handle a single moment to stop, breathe, and process what was going on. Severely disappointed by the crew behind the scenes who took what we loved about the characters and that world and thoroughly destroyed it with cheap animation, wonky dialogue, childish jokes targeted to make you laugh every two seconds, and not including the Furious Five just to make a joke while sidelining Shifu and the past villains made for just an all around sour taste. Unfortunately there was no eye for genuine filmmaking like DreamWorks used to be so great at having especially when this had the potential to be the most interesting and creatively crafted film in the whole Kung Fu Panda franchise. How do you get this wrong when the pieces were right in front of you to satisfyingly follow up and conclude an otherwise amazing series. While its still out for anyone to form their own opinion, if you feel its not necessary to give a try then you dont have to. 0/10.",-1
3.5,"Good. Not incredible. Worthy entry of the franchise, but pacing was a bit too fast and the comedy was a little more kiddy than the others.",0
5.0,Fun and entertaining,1
5.0,"As always funny characters, action that kids will enjoy. Took my grandkids they both enjoyed even grandfather was laughing.",1
4.5,Great for kids and family... Predictable but fun story line and animations...,1
0.5,It was the worst one made. It was like someone completely different did the movie from the first 3. It was not funny and the scenes felt like scenes from other movies just moved into this one. My kids made fun of it the entire ride home.,-1
5.0,Very Funny !!!! And my kids loved it .,1
4.5,Always a great movie in this series. We love the message and the positive vibes. Definitely OK for the kiddos.,1
3.0,So disappointed that the other caracters were not in the movie,0
4.0,Fun with new characters!,1
5.0,"I didnt want Po to be forced to become a spiritual advisor and needed to find a successor. However, I am happy he did find someone though who was actually worthy of becoming the next Dragon Warrior and the actress who played the successor was incredible in her role throughout the film as she overcame her struggles internally and externally and eventually transformed into an incredible martial arts fighter worthy of being the next Dragon Warrior.",1
1.5,"Great movie for kids nowadays who have no attention span and lack of understanding for any media with impact. This movie felt so weak, I can't believe it's a kung fu panda movie",-1
5.0,We love everything about Kung Fu Panda!!,1
0.5,My baby is battling brain cancer and he was sick so we didn't get to see the movie and we called Fandango and they refused to give him another ticket so we never even got to watch it.,-1
0.5,They rushed the movie and ruined the ending. Still believe Po should have remained the dragon warrior,-1
4.0,"I loved this movie and the characters. I would see it again. I thought the fight scenes were a little long and quite often , but they were still good",1
2.0,Low quality writing. Dialog was mostly cringe slapstick humor. Fights were a mixed bag of good and not feeling they were impactful. Animation itself was good.,-1
5.0,"Great movie, funny !!",1
5.0,So many laughing streaks during this movie. Love it.,1
4.5,"Im a 71 year old grandpa who took my 4 grandkids - 14 yr old twin grandsons, 11yr old granddaughter & 8 yr old grandson. We ALL loved the movie! Good for all ages!",1

5.0,"I took my son to see this movie for his birthday, he said it was so funny and he enjoyed it",1
3.0,"Better than expected, if somewhat predictable. Made me laugh out loud a few times. My favorite part was the Tenacious D cover of Baby One More Time at the end.",0
3.5,"This movie was very cute and is definitely a good movie for kids, even though I saw it with my SO without kids. Even though, this is the fourth installment, they still do a pretty good job of keeping the movie funny for both kids and adults.",0
5.0,"Love it, it was funny.",1
3.5,It was entertaining but not the quality of the other movies as far as story line. It never explained who the villian was and why she wanted the power so badly. We missed the Furious Five soooo much. Not the same without them. The fight scenes were good and over all an entertaining movie especially for a 4th movie.,0
5.0,Kids loved the movie!!,1
5.0,"Love movie Super kawaii and very entertaining, fun to watch with the whole family. Never disappointed!!!",1
3.0,"moderate film, but tried to hard to go for the wow factor and ended up feeling like a forced copy of spider-man no way home. entertaining, but lacked any real substance and didnt come close to making the viewer as emotionally invested and captivated as the first two movies in the series.",0
5.0,Love it and seeing all the bad guys coming,1
2.5,The story had some potential but ultimately felt rushed.,-1
5.0,Loved Awkwafina in her role. My grandson said it was the best of the series.,1
2.0,"animation and music was phenomenal. story? characters? dialogue? horrible, it was like watching a marvel movie. everything felt rushed and ignored the previous movies that built po. this movie does not exist. there's only 3 kung fu panda movies.",-1
1.0,Terrible - did they just steal the plot from Cars 3? That movie was bad enough with predictable plot. This movie was even worse.,-1

5.0,Very good. Must watch.,1
5.0,It has goog morality teaching.,1
5.0,My daughter loved the movie,1
5.0,Loved the animation and the subtle adult innuendos.,1
5.0,Very funny ‚Ä¶. Great family picture!,1
0.5,The movie was fast paste like they rushed thru it too many previews not to mention it did not attract my kids attention like it was supposed to and I couldnt even get a refund spend 100 between tickets and concessions,-1
5.0,"A must see. Funny, exciting and powerfully inspiring. Great to see a new level to the story of the different characters. Loved getting to see the past meet the future of the different stories and the respect shown Po. Loved this movie. Great job from all of the cast. Love the revision of the Ozzy Osbourne song Crazy Train and Britney Spears Hit Me Baby One More Time.",1
5.0,It was great as the other ones were. Im so glad my son and I went to see it. The ending was so cute.,1
3.5,Too much useless action and the jokes were bad,0

5.0,I'm not sure why kungfupanda 4 only got 6.7-ish stars but we thought it was AWESOOOOME!!! It was the action and graphics for me @dreamworks buen trabajo!!! movies theatre,1
1.0,Too dark and scary for a kids movie.,-1
5.0,"Nos gust mucho esta pelcula, mi nio sali muy contento de ver Kung Fu Panda 4",1
4.0,"Not bad at all. Nothing new brought to the series, but an entertaining movie for kids. Good soundtrack.",1
5.0,This was a good movie. I took my granddaughter out to see it so I might be a bit biased. I will admit that I've not seen the previous movies.,1
5.0,divertida . buena pel√≠cula!,1
5.0,I saw it w family 3D! So much fun!,1
3.0,My teenager said he wished whole original cast was in it more. It was good but not the best one.,0
5.0,"It was pretty good, non stop action",1
4.0,My eight year old says 4/5,1
4.0,"Really good action and comedy, pretty cliche ending tho. Would recommend to watch with the fam.",1
4.0,My kids absolutely loved it. It was not as full or engaging for us adults as the previous movies. The story was a bit flat and unemotional. It felt like just a weak reason to make a sequel for a quick profit. If they do another we will definitely watch it but will probably wait for it to come out on a streaming service,1
5.0,Saw it in 3D...really fun movie to watch for the whole family. Really creative way of bringing back characters from the earlier movies. Well done.,1
5.0,I liked the storyline. Lots of action.,1
3.5,"Movie was good but felt forced. I did not think a 4th sequel was necessary.. Saying all that, the movie was good for families with kids.",0
5.0,It's was really good,1

5.0,It was a great family friendly movie filled with action and tons of laughs.,1
4.5,Great and funny movie!,1
5.0,I loved it! I almost want to see it again. It was a fun movie.,1
4.0,"Although there was violence, the good guys win, with the effort of the family. Good triumphs over evil. Lots of catchy lines that have good thoughts.",1
0.5,"The movie was very entertaining for both adults and children. However, this is the most satanic childrens movie Ive seen a while. For children, it normalizes violence, satanic rituals, and child trafficking with blood writing, trafficking symbols, demonic graphics, etc. if you do not mind that stuff then youll like it.",-1
4.0,"Not as great as the others but definitely decent. Also not too long, which is nice.",1
5.0,i liked how po came in and saved the day well also having his new friend betray the chameleon to help po,1
2.0,Its not what we expect. We thought that 4th one will much better then the 3th. It's ok but not for young childrens for Adults is just fine.,-1
4.5,"The graphics and vibrant visuals were stunning, as always, and the exhilarating soundtrack was well selected for the action scenes. However, with that being said, there was noticeably less action compared to the three previous Kung Fu Pandas. I was expecting a longer ""ultimate"" fight scene at the movie's end, but it didn't take much for victory and the movie's resolution. For Po's last movie as the Dragon Warrior, it seemed the action scenes fell somewhat short. I was also disappointed that the Furious Five had nonexistent roles. With all this being said, this movie was well worth the tickets and experiencing it in theaters. When compared to other movie series that flopped, I'd say Kung Fu Panda 4 still drawn in and excited fans.",1
3.0,It was pretty much exactly the same as all the others,0
5.0,"Nice Movie, all the age groups will enjoy.",1
3.5,"Beautiful graphics, great detail of animation.",0

2.0,meh. it had the bones of a solid story but that was it,-1
4.0,"Very cool, it was a good movie.",1
1.0,Poor direction and writing. Good plot but they went cheap on this movie. Couldve been a great movie but they were too busy saving money.,-1
2.5,they took the soul out of it üíî,-1
4.0,"Voice talent was great, movie is fast paced with lots of action and funny lines.",1
5.0,Great movie. Best from the franchise!,1
5.0,I LOVE WATCHING CHILD PO,1
5.0,"Still fresh and entertaining, even after 4 films.",1
4.0,"While I see this as an unnecessary sequel to a trilogy that was already great as is, I still highly recommend watching this! Me and my friends laughed a bunch of times at the visual humor and the clever wordplay, as well as be absolutely amazed with the scenery, art direction, and the creative chase and fight scenes. The story itself is pretty straight forward and predictable, but the journey to the end was incredibly fun, and I found Jen (the fox thief) to be cute, silly, and loveable despite her snarkiness and tomboyish nature. I do feel like a lot of opportunities were missed with this one, like with Tai Lung being very minimally involved, and the Chameleon Empress being incredibly one-dimensional with no backstory at all (but her voice actress, abilities, and humor did make up for some of it). I also think this might be an excuse for a fifth movie to focus on the Furious Five's adventures, and of a sixth movie does ever come out, I'm willing to bet it's going to be on Shifo's death.",1
5.0,Great movie. Excellent script and story. Great movie to watch with kids.,1
4.5,"Not as good as the first three, but I refuse to leave a bad rating on Kung Fu Panda. Because I‚Äôd still like to see a fourth, maybe with a little more Furious Five üòÄ",1
3.0,not as good as expected,0
4.5,Loved everything! Hit me Baby One More Time was a great end!!!,1
5.0,It was good clean family fun! Jokes for kids and jokes for adults.,1
5.0,Great movie! My mom and I enjoyed seeing Po on the big screen again!,1
3.5,decent plot and story along with the awesome cinematography and sound effects.,0
3.0,"A little too advanced for a 3-year-old and more fighting than I would have preferred, but I guess I should have expected that at a movie with ""Kung Fu"" in the name. Our grandson was a bit fidgety at this movie because I don't think he understood much of the dialogue.",0
5.0,fantastic movie for the family,1
5.0,"Entertaining and funny . My granddaughter loves all the Panda movies, and this one, was no exception.",1

5.0,It was a good kids movie with adult humor!,1
5.0,Very entertaining and movie thats ok to watch with kids. Very funny moments throughout the movie. We liked it.,1
2.0,"if you have kids, and those kids love Po the character, then this movie is for them. if you're in it for the story and Kung Fu fighting universe, this is as serviceable as toy story 4. but at least that movie had a definitive conclusion for the characters. this movie sets up for the new storyline in the tree with just slap stick for kids.",-1
5.0,It held the same vibe as the others. Entertaining and funny,1
5.0,It was great! Action Packed!,1
2.0,Good animation But story writing very poor . Character development was poor . Movies was too rushed Good animation Comedy was not great,-1

5.0,It was a good movie for the hole family.,1

5.0,My kids and I love it,1
5.0,We loved this movie. It was amazing,1
5.0,Best of all three sequels,1
0.5,This movie was purely a money grab. For such an awesome franchise Kung fu panda had a lazy story that destroys much of the previous three movies plots.,-1
5.0,Grandson really enjoyed it. Was a funny movie.,1
3.5,Felt that the previous movies were better.,0
2.0,It had a lot of witch craft and demonic undertones. It scared my 4 year old. The plot was poorly written.,-1
3.5,I liked the story line. Glad to see old and new characters in this story,0
5.0,"Honestly, it was a pretty good movie. Only watched the first two movies (I think), but luckily this movie provides a small recap and was quite enjoyable to watch.",1

5.0,"The Best Kung Fu Panda so far! Both my 11 year old and myself loved this movie in 3D! So much depth, very well done 3D. We loved how they mixed up the formula, the new fox character was great, the shapeshifter was really cool. We had a lot of fun and it was the perfect run time for a father and son run to the theatre. Lots of comedy. A+ recommended",1
2.5,Overall it was a good movie but had to leave because my 2 young ones got too scared towards the end. 1st 3 we had no issues with that but this one is not geared towards the younger audience,-1
5.0,It was a good addition to the Kung fu panda movies. It also possibly started another movie.,1
5.0,Loved the whole show!,1
5.0,If you liked all the other Ku fu Panda movies then you will enjoy this one as well,1

4.0,no furious 5 until like a 3 second clip at the end,1

5.0,Very good movie. Enjoyed it with my kids. Very entertaining from start to finish.,1
3.0,It was decent to watch wasent a complete waste of time however it wasn't crazy amazing as the adds it was just okay at best. Would wait till it goes on amazon prime Kungfu panda 2 and 3 have better story and more interesting plots than this one and better story.,0
4.0,The animation was terrific and the messages of family relationships and friendships were great. However I think those messages could have been conveyed in a way that could increase their importance to the viewers. Over-all it was still a very good movie.,1
5.0,"First thank you for the movie. I enjoyed it. It was funny, very entertaining..",1

5.0,Grate option for the kids and adults,1
4.5,One of the best in the franchise. I enjoyed nearly everything about it. The only negative I have with it is the exclusion of the Furious Five. Also The Chameleon is one of the best villains I‚Äôve seen in an animated film. I‚Äôm gonna give Kung Fu Panda 4 an A-.,1
5.0,Might be the best out of the three other movies in my opinion,1
2.0,Only for those who are fans and missed kung fu panda. Doesn‚Äôt progress the story like the 2nd movie did. Not terrible though.,-1

4.0,"The movie was good but it left me wanting for more, like it was missing a kick to it. But overall it was nice to watch.",1

5.0,The movie was amazing and so much fun.,1

5.0,"I loved the movie, I would and did recommend this movie to my friends.",1

5.0,"KFP4 is a rare 4th installment that does justice to the original. Beautiful animation, great action/fight sequences, a fun adventure, good humor, and cool new characters, one of which being a great main villain. The Furious 5 are missed but the film is great nonetheless.",1
5.0,Kept their attention the whole time.,1
4.0,Many familiar characters returned for this and the storyline was well thought out... It didn't feel like it was whipped out over a weekend to make a quick buck... I had real character growth in it and I'm sure the little ones will enjoy it even if they hardly know who Po is... I won't explain further since that could easily spoil things...,1
3.0,Not as humorous as other animated movies. It was sort of dull.,0
3.5,Not a memorable story or villain but alway nice to see the adventures Po embarks on,0

5.0,Great. Hard to follow but well executed. Didn't fix audio lip mixing. Would love a sequel.,1
4.5,"Everything is still great about this movie except for the 75% inaudible dialogue, which is still terrible.",1
5.0,Jesus God TENET should be on every IMAX Screen like once a week in Perpetuity. Nolan spy movie WORKS in IMAX screens only. You just cannot replicate this experience at home.,1
5.0,You have never seen a movie like it before and will never see a movie like it in the future! Truly another cinematic classic by Christopher Nolan.,1
5.0,Amazing to see in theaters. Also very loud.,1
5.0,Christopher Nolan is proved once again to be a pioneer and genius of his field.,1
5.0,"It‚Äôs awesome, complex, confusing and epic",1

5.0,Watching this in IMAX intensified this movie,1
5.0,"Whether this is your first viewing or a re-watch, Tenet will leave you with a grand time and questions in your mind for years to come.",1
5.0,Better on IMAX than at home! Glad they brought it back to how it should be seen.,1
4.0,"Nowhere near Christopher Nolan‚Äôs greatest offering, but a wild, compulsively watchable ride. Seeing it in 70mm IMAX twice has made me a true believer in the format. We need more spectacle features like this.",1
4.0,Nolan never disappoints..,1
5.0,truly something you've never seen before! fantastic acting and such a fun movie! you truly felt immersed!,1
5.0,Saw this miraculous film back in 2020 when it came out and saw it in the fake IMAX and finally saw it in the way it was meant to be seen. Nolan is a true master when it comes to storytelling and making you keep on guessing till the end and keep on going back for rewatch. It is a technical marvel and the sound design is amazing. There were a lot of complaints of the sound mix when it came out but here its masterful. The score from Ludwig Gorransson is amazing and as well as the cinematography from Hoyte Van Hoytema and the use of IMAX. Love this film. It has a coolness vibe to it almost similar to Michael Mann and Nolan should be proud of this film,1
5.0,"It's another amazing Chris Nolan film. Visuasl, sound and acting are top notch.",1
4.5,.asterfully crafted. I got amazed by the edits/ and confused by the lack of sound design.,1
4.0,"lots going on and sometimes hard to follow, especially on the first viewing. But overall a great movie with incredible visuals.",1
5.0,well written script with homage paid to an original classic. This film is worth seeing twice if not a third time. Great horror film of modern times.,1
4.0,Hard to follow story at every turn but action was fun to watch and it was filmed in a way that made the parts that were hard to understand chronologically still enjoyable!,1
5.0,Truly Revolutionary. You have to catch it a second and even third time to really take it all in. Great attention to detail. Loved it!,1
5.0,"Anything Peter Jackson touches turns to gold, well maybe not the Hobbit series, but this was fantastic!",1
5.0,Movie was excellent. Dialog was hard to understand. Classic Nolan.,1
3.0,Not a sci fi fan. Will have to watch again. Love John David,0
3.0,Hard to understand movie. Great action. Denzel Washington would be my choice for lead role in this movie.,0

5.0,"Phenomenal Film!! Nolan does not disappoint, and an extraordinary cast.",1
4.0,"good action, detailed plot, characters well played",1
5.0,My first film after a year of Covid. I was hoping for it to be on the big screen. Wasn't disappointed. Like going to church except the popcorn was stale. Maybe next time fresher popcorn.,1
5.0,Great film! Great action music and acting! Really like the story makes you think for days!,1
4.5,Adrenaline flowing from start to finish.,1
2.5,"Hopelessly confusing. Should have come with subtitles to decipher the English accents and the low dialogue volume. The constant explanations the characters give about what's going on, clarify nothing. Just a couple of swaggering dudes strutting around kicking butt and taking names - being crossed in multiples of two.. Impossible to spoil, cause that would imply that I know what the story is. The inverse of excitement.",-1
5.0,very interesting movie,1
5.0,"TENET LOOKS INCREDIBLE IN 70mm IMAX 15 perf FILM,",1
5.0,i have been waiting to see this movie on this screen. loved every moment as if it was the first time i seen it.,1

2.5,Too confusing for me,-1
5.0,Awesome except the soundtrack sucked. You could not understand the dialogue 80% of the time.,1
4.0,"Really fun and cool plot. starts off slow but builds to crazy middle and ending. The movie is confusing, but leaves enough for you to understand as it progresses. Definitely need a second watch. Vocals hard to hear at times",1
3.0,"The visuals, thrills, and concepts are strong. I wish I could say the same for everything else.",0
0.5,"Probably the most confusing movie I have ever watched. My brain was more exhausted than any math exam I have ever taken. If zero was a rating, I would score it a zero.",-1
3.0,It was a decent movie but the first hour or so was very confusing,0
4.0,Explores some nifty aspects of time travel while delivering action beats.,1
4.0,The movie had a good storyline but it's very convoluted-pay very close attention. The story can be hard to follow.,1
2.0,"I love cerebral movies, however this one falls off the edge. The story writer must have been tripping on mushrooms as he tumbled down a rabbit hole.",-1
3.5,"solid movie, didn't feel as long as it is. there were slower parts, but it was interesting. confusing, but interesting.",0
4.0,I was a little confused,1
5.0,"a bit hard to follow at first but the cast and visuals hold the movie firm. absolutley loved it, even though my wife had no idea what was going on",1
5.0,"Never rated a movie before, but I loved this film! Mind-bending stuff!",1
3.0,unable to follow and slow start but good action sequences.,0
3.0,Great action & amazing scenes. Didnt like violence against women. Too many inconsistencies and unexplained events. Should have had subtitles because with many characters accents I couldnt understand half of what they were saying.,0
2.5,Confusing movie to say the least,-1
5.0,I enjoyed the underline story and all the action.,1
4.0,"Huge opening scene but then it dipped then picked back up, unique spin on and old concept. Left room to continue the story.",1
5.0,This movie keep you on your toes.,1
5.0,probably the only movie from this year that made us wish about all the fucked up things in this year started traveliing back in time to a reset point.,1
2.0,"Worst plot ever! Too confusing, unrealistic and didn‚Äôt understand if the scene was in the past or present.",-1
0.5,This was by far the worst movie I have seen in 2020. The plot was too hard to follow and my brother saw it for the second time with me and still did not understand connections between major story lines. Overall really doo doo,-1
1.5,Sound effects and sound tracks were terrible,-1
4.0,Certainly a movie you have to be focused on but extremely entertaining and great acting.,1
5.0,Great intellectual movie! One of those movies that you need to see a couple of times so you see all of the hidden things!,1
5.0,This movie is goddamn perfection. If you don‚Äôt see it 5 times in theaters then you are a board-certified idiot.,1
5.0,"Watch it first to enjoy it, watch it twice to understand it",1
2.0,It was terribly confusing and nonsensical. There was some cool action scenes but not worth sitting for 2.5 hours wondering what the heck is going on.,-1
2.0,It didn‚Äôt make sense,-1
5.0,"i loooved this movie - its so good, i will definitely have to see it again to understand the whole inverted thing but overall i loved it.",1
3.5,"It was engaging. I wanted to know what would happen next, but it was confusing. I feel like I need to watch it a second time to understand both detail and major plot points.",0
4.0,"Great movie,slot of action.",1
5.0,"Loved it, has to be best movie of the year !! For me atleast",1
5.0,"I think Christopher Nolan‚Äôs intent with this movie was to go bigger than he ever has with his mind-boggling movies in the past and he certainly did not fall short of that. A lot of action movies these days tend to spoonfeed the audience simple plots driven by cool CGI effects and big actors. Admittedly, as much fun as those are to watch sometimes, Tenet was definitely a nice change of pace. While most movies tend to always let you know exactly what the characters are doing and why, Tenet takes a different approach by throwing the viewer into a world where they are never really quite sure what is going on even when the pieces do start to come into place. While this may prove frustrating to some viewers, Tenet is the kind of film that makes the audience really work for it and actively think to understand it. There are gonna be times when you might be confused and that‚Äôs just something you‚Äôre gonna have to accept. But that‚Äôs a kind of uniqueness not found in most films today. It seems as if Nolan had a specific demographic of people in mind when making this. Instead of trying to sell out to the masses, he expects people that are watching this to be confused at first but keep learning things throughout the movie. And even keep wanting to learn beyond a first watch. I saw this movie once and I‚Äôm already thinking about seeing it a couple more times to really understand what was going on. While I will admit this is definitely not a relaxing movie that you can half-pay attention to for everyone, if you are willing to focus and pay attention to the details, I would highly recommend giving this unique spin on time-travel a shot.",1
5.0,the movie was absolutely excellent I love the way they did the whole time traveling thing. I love how they did not try and explain how they were able to do it.,1
2.0,Loved all of Christopher Nolans up to this point - but this one has 2 strikes against it. Its a tremendously difficult undertaking and story line. So having actors with accents speaking into oxygen masks for critical/key dialog is strike one -and Normally I love accents - but these were just too muddy to hear due to the masks. Second is the sound engineering in general- way too loud mixing on soundtrack - the background noises and effects drowning out key points of dialogue. I have excellent Hearing so that isnt the case - this is just terrible sound editing and mixing . Great concept/story line - just a disappointing movie experience with sound and dialogue.,-1
5.0,Riveting action from beginning to end!!,1
3.0,"complex story, simple story line",0
1.0,Was not a good movies. Story line was hard to follow. I almost fell asleep and we walked out and hour or so in to the movie.,-1
5.0,Highly recommend you watch it multiple times and the story becomes crystal clear. Great performances and execution.,1
5.0,It‚Äôs very interesting and good... you have to really pay attention to get the whole concept but still very good! Secret: pay attention to the small details,1
4.0,Really liked the movie but had to get an employee to fix the movie quality:/,1
5.0,Nolan did it again. Instant classic. Great acting. Unique themes.,1
5.0,Very much needed to see a good movie on the big screen,1
4.0,"Loved the cinematography, the plot, direction, and the acting. Disliked not being able to understand what was being said sometimes due to the sound mixing (or editing?) and the movie was a bit confusing at times.",1
0.5,"slow and unimaginable, worse movie I've ever seen.",-1
4.5,Would be a perfect film if the sound editing was better,1
5.0,Action in every scene. Lots of twists and turns.,1
4.0,Seems like a movie you have to watch 2-3 times before fully appreciating,1
4.5,This movie was amazing bro Christopher Nolan outdid himself,1
0.5,"A loud, confusing, shoot-'em-up mess with a leading character who has all the personality and charm of a flea.",-1
5.0,It was a very fast paced movie and I had to pay attention but everything came together at the end. I would watch it again.,1
1.5,"So hard to follow, very confusing movie. I had a feeling that I am dreaming and nothing makes any sense.",-1
4.0,"This movie was very entertaining. It did not let up for the 2 1/2 hr runtime! However, it was very physics heavy. The director did a decent job visually explaining things, but it can get confusing quick without a fundamental idea of quantum physics, space time, and entropy. It is not completely accurate... science majors may have issues. But if you watch it for what it is, it's incredible! The fight scenes are probably the best that I have ever seen and both leads did an amazing job. I've heard a lot of people say that they were confused, I would watch it once, watch something explaining the theories they explored, and watch it a second time. Don't let me scare you off though or discourage you from seeing the movie. There is nothing like this in cinema. For any science enthusiast, it's great to see a movie try to visually explore ideas that are hard to wrap your brain around. And for any action movie lover or movie making enthusiast, this is the first of its kind and it will blow your mind! Incredible talent and visually stunning.",1
1.0,"If I could give this movie a -5, I would. It was absolutely horrible. Difficult to understand and hard to follow. I would NOT recommend this movie to anyone!",-1
0.5,Very hard to follow the plot Almost asked for my money back,-1
0.5,Horrible long movie. Hard to follow. Boring and uncaptivating.,-1
2.5,"Man I wanted to like it... like I wanted to like Lady In Water after I saw The Village. But alas, here we are, a limp wiener on your honeymoon.",-1
1.0,Very confusing !!! Have no idea what I was watching lol !!!!,-1
5.0,"Ridiculously over-the-top action! Lots of fun, and well worth the IMAX ticket!",1

5.0,It was a great story! Kept us on the edge of our seats.,1
2.5,You really have to pay attention from the beginning. It was kinda confusing and boring. I wouldn't see it again,-1
4.5,"mind bending. sometimes hard to understand I'm more ways than one. have to watch multiple times, but another great movie from nolan.",1
1.0,Very far fetched and overdone.,-1
3.0,"2 1/2 hours later, I have no idea what this movie was about. I think you need to see it a few times to understand even half of what was going on...",0
0.5,"Terrible movie, incredibly confusing!! Storyline makes no sense - don‚Äôt waste your time or money!!",-1
4.0,"It was kinda confusing to understand everything, but as you think of it, its actually quite interesting. It was a huge plot twist to find out how everything unraveled",1
1.0,Terrible lead actor.,-1
4.0,Awesome action. I just had no idea what was going on. Explanation was too quick to understand,1
4.5,I think I‚Äôll need to see it twice to fully understand it but still cool.,1
5.0,Extremely creative and enjoyable. Action packed and gave you the option of really thinking and analyzing or just enjoying the ride. Christopher Nolan never fails to give us something new. 2 1/2 hours went by very quickly with very little downtime in the movie.,1
4.5,"This was simultaneously the most spectacular film I have ever seen and the most confusing. Seeing it in IMAX was a treat, though the dialogue was nigh impossible to hear in several instances. Will need to rewatch several times with subtitles to get the full picture.",1
3.5,It is a movie you have to give all your attention.,0
0.5,Horrible movie. Walked out. Plot was ridiculous.,-1
2.0,Long confusing special effects LOUD soft dialog,-1

3.0,Hard to follow the plot but I enjoyed the action scene,0
5.0,Absolutely immersive movie that made me reconsider blinking,1
4.5,Acting was great but sometimes hard to understand the actors.,1
5.0,"I went to see it last night with my lady and it was amazing. The cast, the story and the action scenes were all so good. We're going to see it again so we can get a few questions answered. Other than that, Nolan made just about a perfect film. It kept us in it for the whole duration of the film. If you haven't seen it on Imax, I recommend go now because we have no idea how much longer the film will be out there. Cheers!",1
1.5,I still don't know what I watched or why any of it was happening.,-1
4.5,Great film all around,1
3.0,I was partially confused but it was a good action packed movie.,0

2.0,Hard to follow story line not good,-1
0.5,"I‚Äôm certain that this was the worst movie I‚Äôve ever seen in my entire life! You couldn‚Äôt pay me to sit through this sloppy mess of a movie a second time. There was no need for this movie to be longer than your average 1 1/2 hour film. Why they thought dragging it out for 2 1/2 was a good idea?? For what? Completely unnecessary! Camera work was below average, left theatre with a head ache,. Story line? Retarded! Acting? Horrible! Id much rather watch paint dry than watch this movie again. God awful!!",-1
2.5,To hard to understand,-1
1.0,Man this was painful. Just because you are telling a story that operates forwards and backwards doesn't mean you have to also make the movie twice as long as it needs to be. And not a single likeable character in this muddled storyline,-1
2.0,Snooze for Sci-Fi avoiders,-1
4.0,"Overall good action movie. Sometimes a little hard to follow, but makes sense in the end.",1
5.0,"Awesome flick. Revolutionary. Very cerebral and action packed. Absolutely deserving of 5 stars. I highly doubt anyone will walk away disappointed. However, I took one star away because of how easily the main character accepts the abstract concepts he's presented with. Other than that though, if you only see one movie in 2020, which is very possible, make it Tenet. It IS actually best seen on the big screen, it wasn't just Christopher Nolan's ego.",1
3.5,"good not great effort to retell the temporal cold war story arc from Star Trek Enterprise.the acting was very good,but they tried to take a story that Enterprise took 4 years to tell and jam it into a 2 hour movie leaving many confused about the movie. a 2 part movie arc would have been better to tell the story.still I give it 7 out if 10",0
1.0,"I was totally lost. Difficult to hear actors behind gas masks, plot too complicated. Did not enjoy",-1
3.5,"I very interesting plot although at times it's hard to figure out, but who can comprehend ""time inversion"" even when seeing it. Good action segments and acting. However this is one of those movies you need to watch again to fully understand everything.",0
2.0,totally lost as top what the heck was going on and hard to understand their conversations,-1
5.0,"I read mixed reviews but if the plot lost you, try paying attention next time. I thought it was another brilliant movie by Nolan. Loved it. Washington and Pattinson were great.",1
5.0,Great movie. Action packed,1

3.0,Plot is a little long and a little confusing dealing with time manipulation...,0
2.5,Music was so loud and all the actors were whispering,-1
5.0,Awesome movie. Plot is great. Watch to the end to tie all the things that didn‚Äôt make sense at the beginning.,1
4.0,It was a great movie with a boatload to take in and it leaves you guessing at the end long after the credits roll. Started a but fast but gained a steady pace to a great finish.,1
2.0,Hard to follow. Couldnt understand a lot of the dialogue with the accents and constant loud music in the background during dialogue.,-1

4.0,"my brain hurts. trying to follow the timeline, who is going forward or backwards in which world is crazy. whoever thought up the temporal pincer maneuver was on crack. if you can see the outcome in the future then you can go back to the past and change the outcome so no pincer required...",1

4.0,"Was not as good as I thought it would be, the plot line was a little hard to follow.",1
3.0,extremely hard to follow the dialog. they tried to be extremely sophicfaited using complex theory but it was a little difficult to follow. However I live the premise and the actors in the movie.,0
4.5,Awesome and very well made,1
5.0,"What a movie! I've really missed the cinema and this was worth setting in the big screen. Yes, it's complicated, maybe too complicated, but that only makes me want you see it again. Memento is clearly Christopher Nolan having gone back in time to start learning how to make the kind of movies that would allow him to eventually make Tenet ü§Ø",1

1.0,Confusing! Could not understand most of the dialogue. Confluented time travel story.,-1
4.5,it was good hard to follow a couple of times but good and action packed,1
2.0,Too confusing. I consider myself fairly intelligent but the concept was frankly too much to absorb in a single setting. Anyone that left the movie saying they got it is probably a liar....,-1
5.0,a little slow in the beginning but worth it in the end.,1
4.0,Good movie. Entertaining. Complex. I think it will require many viewings to fully understand.,1
5.0,hAVE TO SEE IT TWICE...fantastic!,1
4.0,I will watch it again to fully understand the plot.,1
4.5,BEST movie I‚Äôve seen in a while!! Kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time and the ending was such a twist!! It‚Äôs a must see!,1
3.5,"Visually amazing with impressive shots to help support the imagination of the plot, but the the storyline becomes so overwhelmingly complex that it creates inconsistencies and convolution within the world. I still really liked it but with Christopher Nolan, there are complex stories but usually have a direct answer after watching or rewatching, but with TENET I believe there will be questions that will never get answered.",0
5.0,It kept me guessing!,1
5.0,"I disliked nothing. The movie was absolutely phenomenal, most definitely would see it again!!!",1
5.0,"Fantastic film, very good action movie made by Nolan, man can do no wrong!",1
5.0,"Must watch in Dolby Cinema, incredible action",1
3.0,"It was alright. The concept made sense but there was just too much crammed into the movie also very loud. Cinemark's fault I guess. Also kinda cheesy that the protagonist would sacrifice his own life for his country yet compromise his position for a random woman. If you like Inception, feel free to watch this. It's a bit deeper to grasp than Inception in my opinion.",0
0.5,Horrible or maybe I‚Äôm just dumb. Didn‚Äôt understand at all. I‚Äôm not dumb.,-1
5.0,"Very futuristic, and loved the action. I enjoyed the movie a lot a really big twist at the end!",1
5.0,Sometimes hard to follow but it was a good mind twister. Reminded me of inception but that movie was less confusing lol,1
3.5,"Visuals and sound were awesome, concept was awesome, a must for Christopher Nolan fans. But, many times during movie you ask yourself ‚Äúwhat is the main point, where is this going?‚Äù In the end it makes sense but it may take a few watches to find all that is intended.",0
5.0,I liked the futuristic concept of the storyline. The action scenes portrayed in reverse. All of the actors were superb!,1
5.0,FANTASTIC .. not since Inception did I have to think so much. love a story where you actually need to think. Tons of action. Excellent casting. Definitely going to buy it.,1
4.0,It was hard to follow at first but it was very exciting and quite possibly Nolan's best work!,1
3.0,Very hard to follow the story line. It ended up being pretty good due to the action scenes.,0
4.0,"Christopher Nolan‚Äôs New film üéû ‚Äî brilliant screenplay, performances , and Ludwig G√∂ransson‚Äôs score amazing. The sound of the actors performances however, is difficult to hear clearly at times, don‚Äôt let that deter you from the thrill of the ride and complexes of the plot!",1
3.5,Brilliant storyline but doesn't elaborate enough on what's happening at the beginning.,0
1.5,"Movie was well acted and marvelously photographed but the sound seemed muddled at times and I really did not know what was going on. Things were simultaneously happening in the past, the present and the future - I think. I'm was not sure who were the good guys and who were the bad guys - or which side actually won.",-1
4.0,I think I‚Äôll like it even more after watching it a few more times to process all the details.,1
5.0,I have to see it again and maybe again after that. Definitely one of those movies you just have to see again for many reasons.,1
3.0,Hard to follow at first but comes together at the end. If you don‚Äôt know that you are lost though,0
5.0,"Christopher Nolan has delivered, yet again, a technically ambitious and intellectually perplexing sci-fi action thriller. A film going experience that must be seen to be believed.",1
3.5,"Interesting concept that ties together nicely towards the end. But some of the execution could have been better. Sometimes the plot was a bit confusing and fast due to snappy dialogue. Also, the music and sounds were too loud and often blocked the dialogue, which made things more confusing.",0
5.0,Confusing and yet so much fun!,1
4.0,Super confusing but the acting and action made up for it.,1
0.5,"Way too confusing to enjoy. I like complex ideas in movies but this movie was confusing just for the sake of being confusing. The first scene is the Opera House was the standout scene, unfortunately the rest of the movie just was just not enjoyable at all and I wanted to walk out.",-1

5.0,lots of action but confusing story line,1
2.0,"It was confusing, complicated. completely lost us! we walked out at the 2 hour mark. Didnt matter to us how it ended. interesting CG and filming but plot lost us!",-1
2.0,"Just because you know the word ‚Äúalgorithm‚Äù exists, doesn‚Äôt mean you can use it to mean anything you like.

4.5,A thinking-person‚Äôs movie‚Äîbrilliant in concept and execution. I appreciate how Christopher Nolan‚Äôs movies consistently require a second viewing to fully take it all in.,1
4.0,It was pretty confusing at some points but it was enjoyable none the less.,1
5.0,"It kept you thinking, wondering what was going to happen next. This movie you may have to see more than ones to get the full meaning.",1
5.0,Inventive scenes and plot great music. Makes you think without being some heavy social agenda.,1
2.5,"A bit convoluted, I'd say, even for Christopher Nolan. While generally, concepts explored in TenanT are rooted in Newton's second law of thermodynamics, the fun of this film comes exploring the potential for a macroscopic world (standard model objects), if subject to the exploitations of Maxwell's Demon - a hypothesis constructed from 2 closed systems (of entropy), connected by a theoretical tunnel or door, allowing for reverse entropy flow between the two (ala Maxwell's demon, which Nolan refers to here as ""the spindle"" - inverting people and objects between ""the two flows"" of time, each indicated by its own color pallet, either red or blue, similar to what is observed by Interstellar Doppler shift (as blue light is moving towards you, red moves further away). Ok... ya, it's interesting enough, I suppose. Nothing about this film however is remotely ""scientific,"" much as it is conceptually fun. Same way Land of the Lost is ""conceptually fun"" with a much better sound mix and easier to follow Seriously, the sound on this film can make dialog a real challenge at times, especially one where everybody wears a gas mask (somewhere Bane stands, doing his best Shia LaBeouf clapping meme). To be clear, by sound mix, I am not referring to Ludwig Gransson score of the film, which is absolutely brilliant. Might even be best part of this film Anyway, as I think I've suggested, it just felt, somehow, for Christopher Nolan, this film got away from him. Yeah he ties it together in the end. If it was anyone else I might have given it a higher score. And, I'll give it another go once it's on demand, maybe it'll change my view. But even so, one thing's for sure - Denzel Washington, cannot his son, act. Sorry, John David Washington is likable enough, sure. But, in no way does he have his father's natural talent, command of screen, and presence,.... or for that matter... voice. In fact, more than once I found Washington's performance taking me out of the film, as I thought, ""geez for such 'a badass' why does he (not) 'feel' in charge. Worse he has a way rushing his lines, it feels to me. In fact, I'd say John needs to work on listening skills reacting more to the person he's acting across from, not so much the script (and now everyone wants him for John Stewart's Green Lantern You know Killmonger's dead, better if WB could sign Michael B Jordan I will say for an average film it does keep it space. Fortunately the two and a half hours does not roll slow. That said, not Nolan's best work.",-1
5.0,It was great from start to finish very exciting & suspenseful . The movie is just what we've grown to except from this writer & producer he did a terrific job all around and we both enjoyed it ! We both would like to see it again & there aren't many movies we can say that about.,1
4.5,A wild ride. I‚Äôm still trying to process it.,1
5.0,The cinematography and effects were well done. Sound/voice with backward motion Seemed flawless. Twists and turns with the mix of future and present was fun to decipher. Audible of faces covered with masks was difficult to hear. Actors were well cast.,1
4.5,"Christopher Nolan at his best. Visually impactful, incredible sound, fantastic concept. Look forward to seeing it again",1
1.5,"Perhaps I'm dense, but it was exhausting.",-1
5.0,Awesome. I was fearing it would be confusing for confusing's sake and overly dense but not so! perfectly engaging and a nice return for movies after 7 months (for me).,1
5.0,Incredible story and filmmaking. Will take days to digest the concepts.,1
2.0,Small semblance of a comprehensible plot and great effects. Otherwise this was a snooze.,-1
3.0,Did not understand most of it,0
2.0,Didn‚Äôt like it. Too many of same scenes,-1
5.0,"Fantastic, just buy two tickets now. need to watch it twice. Love it!",1
2.0,kind of slow and hard to figure out what the hell's going on,-1
4.0,First movie in. 8 months. It was wonderful Lots of action and great sound. Kind of confusing with the time jumping.,1
5.0,No words can describe this film. If you didnt enjoy it you operate on low frequency. A masterpiece.,1
5.0,"Amazingly written, produced, and acted! This was my second time seeing it in theaters and it was only better with the second watch. This film is a lot to keep track of mentally but the consecration is worth the plot.",1
5.0,"Christopher Nolan is the absolute best film director of this generation hands down! His ambition, innovation and storytelling is nothing short of spectacular.",1
4.0,Very clever storytelling. I need to watch again in order to understand everything and fill in the blanks.,1
3.5,"It was a good movie, one that you need to pay close attention to.",0
3.5,too hard to follow... very complicated...,0
5.0,"Great movie, action packed, very entertaining üëè",1
4.0,"Takes awhile to figure out whats going on, but very interesting once you. Unlike any other movie. Definitely give it a watch.",1
2.0,"It was ok , if u like delusional type movies. Going into another time. Sci fi",-1
5.0,Almost perfect film.,1
5.0,Intriguing premise. Well done. Dialogue was overpowered by soundtrack sometimes.,1
5.0,"A confusing, timely, masterpiece.",1
4.5,"given that the concept was kinda mind-bending, the story stayed coherent throughout. my only real problem i had was that i swore there were two people in a scene but when the film returned to it, there was only one. it messed up my ability to track the progress of the story. but even with that issue, the film was terrific and riveting, great original story",1
5.0,Go see it. There is nothing like this movie and there never will be. I was on board from the 30 second mark to the time the film ended. And this is coming from someone that tried so hard to look for negetives in this movie and the only thing i concluded was that this mixing was off at points. So what are you waiting for. go see it i'll see you next year when hopefully the world isn't so crap.,1
2.0,The volume was way too loud in the theater,-1
2.0,"Interesting concept to try and attempt, but was bored and confused for the majority of the movie.",-1
2.0,"This movie was so disappointing. The idea and concept were original and well thought out, however the dialogue between characters was as if it were in fast forward. Every scene had so much information being given too fast to process. Even by the end I had a very vague idea of the plot.",-1
5.0,Lots of action! Will keep your attention the entire time!!,1
4.0,"Well done, good cast and acting a little tough to follow. A bit too long.",1
2.5,The movie did not explain the science behind the premise. lots of shooting and playing same scenes backwards but the intelligent component was missing.,-1
5.0,kinda like inception,1
3.5,"It was very complicated and confusing, but beyond that it was very interesting and explored a whole new concept, which I like. The special effects were very cool, but I didn't like how loud the soundtrack got during the action scenes with unnecessary noise. Well acted, though.",0
5.0,Amazing special effects and Complex story line,1
4.5,"Nolan does it again. Beautiful cinematography, intense action, incredible concepts and mind-bending sequences. It‚Äôs what he does best. That being said, there are still a few weaknesses, with the sound mix being a bit poor at times, and a few slow scenes. Still, the visceral experience more than makes up for it. There‚Äôs also a lot going on- even more complicated than Interstellar or Inception. And once it goes all out in the second half, it can be hard to follow. But no one can pull this kind of film off the way Nolan does. 9/10",1
5.0,Par for the Chris Nolan course. Amazing.,1
4.0,Complete mind f@#k and a bit confusing which makes it a good movie.,1
1.0,Terrible sound. Music drowned out the dialogue. It was an unpleasant experience,-1
0.5,Horrible acting.....not worth 2 1/2 hours ...best part was the end!,-1
3.0,The action was good as well as the acting. The storyline was a bit confusing.,0
3.0,Great acting and special effects were overshadowed by an overly complicated script and hard-to-follow temporal timeline.,0
3.0,"I like Nolan‚Äôs films just for the way they look, whatever color temperature he uses is genius. It might be better on the rewatch.",0
5.0,"Tenet is your typical Christopher Nolan movie with incredible cinematography, brilliant effects, and a complex plot line. The movie is everything you would hope it would be.",1
4.0,"Great movie that requires a lot of focus and probably two viewings to really appreciate. Not Nolan's best, but that still puts it way above most everything else.",1
5.0,My brain hurts and that‚Äôs a good thing.,1
3.0,The popcorn was pretty good,0
5.0,"Chris Nolan is a master storyteller and cinematographer and this film highlights that. Yes, it‚Äôs a complex plot that requires that you pay attention but I think that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs such an engaging film",1
5.0,I will be seeing it twice,1
5.0,Truly amazing plot twist. Its concept for the movie Is mind blowing. Recommend 100%.,1
3.0,"It's pretty, but as an Inception reprise, makes even less sense. Worth seeing on the big screen if only to delve deep into the overwhelming feeling of confusion.",0
5.0,Everything I expected a Christopher Nolan movie to be. John David Washington was excellent in this role!,1
5.0,This was a great movie. It keep me in suspense. I liked it so much that I watched it a second time just to find the clues that I missed the first time.,1
5.0,Fantastic. definitely want to see it again!,1
4.5,Loved the story line and Great action throughout!!,1
5.0,Confusing as hell at 1st but then it all starts to make sense and when it comes to and end it‚Äôs freaking awesome,1
3.0,"great action, beautiful scenery, VERY confusing premise- never fully baked.",0
3.0,"Good movie, but youll be confused for the first half",0
5.0,Very good movie but really for cinephiles,1
3.0,"A little confusing to follow. But nonetheless, it was good to be able to see a movie on the big screen after several months.",0
3.0,The first 45 minutes were slow. The concept was cool but it wasn‚Äôt as good as I hoped. I still have questions!,0
2.5,"while I like Christopher Nolan movies, this one just plunges you right into the story and action with little to no character development. the dialogue sounded clever but scripted and far too witty, and you realize that every character is too quick with a response to the other characters and that no one really talks this way. The character of the protagonist you are led to believe is just as clueless as to what is going on and yet the other characters do a very sloppy job of explaining it to him. I'm reasonably intelligent, have worked as a systems engineer for over 30 years, but this movie just did not keep my interest and my family and I walked out halfway through. Better luck next time, Chris!",-1
5.0,"one of the most amazingly mind blowing movies I have ever seen. truly and eye opening aspect when it comes to quantum physics and time travel. If you are not awake, do not waste your time because close minded individuals will not enjoy the intellectual challenging plot in conclusion of this movie!",1
5.0,"He was a great movie, sometimes hard to follow with the time changing back-and-forth, but I loved it anyway. It‚Äôs the first movie I‚Äôve been to since February this year",1
4.0,"Nolan once again delivers a visually stunning piece of film that incorporates immersive sfx, fascinating concepts, and outstanding performances fr it's cast.",1
5.0,"This is my second time seeing tenet, and I have to say that it gets better with each watch",1
1.0,One of the worst movies Ive ever seen. The screenwriter needs to consider a new profession. The story was dumb and the music too loud and the dialogue hard to understand. Waste of time and money,-1
1.5,That says it all. A total waste of time,-1
5.0,Better version of Inception,1
4.0,Great movie but hard to follow the sound mix is terrible,1
5.0,The mystifying affect the movie had on my brain was just wow. The way they went from fighting in normal time to backwards was astounding.,1
3.0,very difficult to follow,0
2.0,It was ok but not something to write about.,-1
5.0,"Great movie, a bit confusing, all worth It in the end",1
5.0,Yes it‚Äôs confusing the first time.... but non stop action and a must see/must rewatch. Have seen people complain about character development and why do we care about these people? Sure hit home for me!,1
1.0,What the heck did I just watch???,-1
2.5,"Terrible....dialogue was garbled and very hard to understand. Sometimes it was even hard to hear....the plot was very hard to follow or understand,",-1
5.0,I loved it. Action pack!,1
3.0,"It was a long movie, but it was worth it.",0
1.0,My friend and I walked out of the theater saying ‚ÄúI have no idea what I just saw.‚Äù I literally can‚Äôt even describe the plot except that Kenneth Branagh plays a bad guy.,-1
3.0,"""Tenet"": 2-1/2 hours of WTF? The movie is filled with marvelous cinematography/effects, as was ""Inception"". But the latter's brilliance was that it assumed a dramatic premise, the control of vivid dreaming, and extended it to the nth-degree while remaining internally consistent. I'm not at all convinced that ""Tenet"" achieves that last goal, but I don't plan to watch it enough times to either prove or disprove the issue. Like I did with ""Inception"".",0
5.0,"This movie was fantastic! Great storyline, wonderful acting and fantastic technical filmmaking! This movie will keep you on the edge of your seats and fill you with anticipation. Would recommend to all!",1
5.0,Like üëçüèø action packed,1
5.0,"I dont think people knew what we were experiencing in that theatre, they get up and laugh, talk, like they just saw a regular movie or another Chris Nolan movie. Mark my words, its a Masterpiece.",1
3.0,A little overdone on plot,0
3.5,"The movie was a bit confusing, but enjoyed the action and the content.",0
2.0,"Mostly good plot great overall story idea. Music was obnoxiously overwhelming. Dialogue was clicky and too fast, as if the characters could read each others' minds. I do not recommend seeing it.",-1
1.0,Hard to follow. What the hell was that?,-1
4.5,"What a ride! Just the right combination of character development, mind bending Christopher Nolan-ness, casting, music and effects.",1
1.0,I gave it a rating of 1 star which is due to you could not hear the actors voices. The soundtrack or background noise dominated over the voices. So while the actor(s) were trying to explain how something worked you could not hear the explanation so as a viewer you are lost and have little to no clue on what is going on. The premise is very interesting and action is good but after not being able to hear the voices we left after an hour hoping that it would improve but never did.,-1
5.0,"It was complex and challenged us to think what‚Äôs going to happen next. Although, it appeared confusing at first, we enjoyed it. 5 stars!",1
5.0,Definitely takes Focus to keep up n understand the movie. Worth watching again to see what I may have missed!,1
3.0,It was more a mind bender plot twist than an actual story.,0
5.0,"Kept me on my toes throughout the whole thing, if youre into thinking about why this movie is for you.!",1
4.0,"Story was very hard to follow... more explaining was needed to get the full experience. But overall, after understanding it, very very good movie.",1
2.0,the story wasn't explained well enough to understand and BELIEVE the premise. it pulled me out of the movie. i wasn't invested,-1
0.5,Way too long on the previews and movie was too long,-1
0.5,One the worst movies I have seen. This was our first movie since February. Such a disappointment and waste of time. This story line is impossible to follow. Save your time and money and see ANYTHING else.,-1
5.0,"Christopher Nolan is as always a genius keeping me guessing and entertained. Story was unique and had me guessing. I can predict almost every movie plot, so I really enjoy being surprised. I love his twists and turns and can‚Äôt wait to rewatch it to really see the magic that is his trademark of how it all fits together from the very start. Acting, graphics, characters and directing all on point!",1
4.5,"A rollercoaster of action, plot twists, and triumph of human strength. If you like Inception, you'll love Tenet.",1
5.0,"It‚Äôs a thinker, and back and forth movie but it was a great movie! Features were awesome and the actors were great!",1
4.5,"Great story, cinematography and effects. Glad for that, because I'll have to watch it at least two more times to grasp all the complexities",1
1.0,Very confusing. Way too long. Walked out. Waste of money.,-1
5.0,"Very convoluted at the beginning, and if you are not a sci-fi fan don‚Äôt bother. But by the 20min mark I was hooked. I need to watch it at least another 2times to understand what I missed but at the end, my heart rate was way up.",1
1.0,"Confusing, difficult to follow. What happened to the code name ""Tenet"" - supposedly key but not invoked in any meaningful way. What was the purpose of the elaborate test of lead character? He was willing to die rather than give up others? So what....",-1
5.0,That film was confusing but so freakin amazing. I want to see it again and again. Nolan is the best of the best.,1
4.0,"Loved the visuals and acting. The overall plot and dialogue was very difficult to follow though, needs several screenings and subtitles to fully understand.",1
2.0,I couldn‚Äôt keep up with what was happening. It is a very confusing movie,-1
2.5,"Interesting but the promos of the premise was not well fulfilled. We didnt care about any of the characters even the self proclaimed Protagonist....action was sometimes Interesting but the story, even for a scientist, was convoluted.",-1
5.0,Most intelligent cinematic experience since Kubrick‚Äôs 2001! Perhaps the.MOST intelligent I‚Äôve ever seen! It is ‚ÄúInception‚Äù perfected.,1
5.0,MIND BLOWN. NEED TO SEE IT AGAIN (and AGAIN),1
2.0,"sound quality was not good and it was hard to understand, plot was difficult to follow",-1
5.0,really awesome mind bender and it was great to go back to the movies,1
3.5,A little long and hard to follow but the acting and effects were great,0
4.0,"The movie was great. I will have to watch it again to get a better understanding, as it was kinda hard to follow, but overall it was great!",1
5.0,Movie was amazing so glad I got to see it in a theater!!,1
0.5,walked out an hour into this movie,-1
5.0,Loved it! Christoper Nolan has always stood out in the film industry,1
1.0,"Was all over the place, very confusing. left early",-1
5.0,"I loved it for the attention to detail with time and everything, but it sure is confusing lol a second watch is almost given.",1
3.0,"The nacho cheese tasted funny.., Popcorn was old and cold...",0
3.0,"Some pretty interesting filming techniques...but after about the first half the complexity gets dialed up to an 11. As long as you‚Äôre ready for a movie that requires some critical thinking, could be enjoyable. If you thought Inception and Interstellar were confusing- maybe stay away from this one.",0
1.0,Such high hopes for this movie. We all ended up leaving with 50 minutes left. Confusing plot and hard to hear the actors talking.,-1
4.0,Action packed mind thriller,1
4.0,"The showing was great! Each scene had my wife and I unable to predict what would happen next. Which for us, is the markings of a movie with taste. Non predictable. Full of reality pondering and question. Now For the reason for the 4/5. Its simple. Much of the audio during conversations were too low to understand, which resulted in some important details being missed. Other than that. Great movie.",1
3.0,Amazing reversed concepts but doesnt outweigh the lack of understanding whats going on the entire movie.,0
4.0,"Christopher Nolan is a terrific Director. Tenet is another example of the talent he has to create movies that are not what they seem. Tenet will have you glued to your seat and anticipating every turn. Forward is backward, left is right and hot is cold nothing is quite what it seems.",1
5.0,This movie is hella good! It‚Äôs a must see movie! 5 stars!,1
4.0,Pay attention. Tons of action. Predictable in some ways. Worth the price of admission.,1
5.0,Great story line...when is Tenet 2 coming out!!,1
4.0,You need to watch this movie more than once to catch all the little nuances. Christopher Nolan has outdone himself!,1
5.0,Really gotta be paying attention. It's a fast paced movie with more than a few twists and turns.,1
3.0,Way too long. Confusing in some parts. Most thing to talk about was combining the forward moving film with the reverse moving. I have no idea why it was considered to be a wait-to-see movie.,0
5.0,Amazingly well done movie. Definitely in my top 10!,1
5.0,Great movie. Must watch over and over,1
2.0,Interesting premise but a convoluted and awkward delivery.,-1
4.0,"Honestly, I was quite confused the entire movie. Only giving 4 stars because the acting seemed decent. I would have to go back and watch this movie again after reading the plot to fully understand it.",1
1.0,"Going to movies is baloney now. Nobody in theaters, feel like sheep cordoned around, the restaurant wasnt open for a matinee movie, wouldnt allow me to bring a blanket in, just disappointing. The movie was one star.",-1
3.0,"A very twisty plot that is often hard to follow, but the special effects and action scenes are amazing. It was only at the end where you could begin to understand the point of the movie. This is not your typical good guy/bad guy action flick.",0
4.0,Typical Christopher Nolan movie that you'll need to see a couple of more times. Great movie lots of action and plot,1
1.0,Very hard to follow storyline. Didn‚Äôt keep our interest,-1
2.0,Very confusing story line. I left the theater an hour into the movie. Not worth my time.,-1
3.5,"The action was great, but the story couldn‚Äôt have been more confusing. I compare the story layout to that of Pulp Fiction. Where as it plays with the time chronology a lot. I kinda hope that there is a sequel to hell tie things together. But we‚Äôll have to see where that goes.",0
3.5,Christopher Nolan does it again! It‚Äôs a movie that makes you go to an all about three times twists and turns you don‚Äôt see coming hence you Miss definitely want to see it again go see this movie don‚Äôt miss out!,0
4.0,It was hard to follow. I might have to see it again. Enjoyed it very much.,1
3.0,An entertaining hot mess,0
2.5,"Not engaging enough, confusing at times. We left mid way.",-1
1.5,"this movie is amazing, it's amazing how they can waste $200 million and 3 hours of my life. the music is so loud in places that you can't even hear the conversation which probably is not a bad thing. the movie teleport you from place to place without any timeline that is continuous through the movie. at one point it became a job just to try to keep up with what's going on and where they at now because they were jumping around so much. at the end of the movie the military forces are fighting an unseen enemy. it looked to me like they just ran out of money at the end and couldn't afford the extra staffing.",-1
5.0,It‚Äôs great. But Nolan as always messed with the sound.,1
0.5,Terrible!! Waste of time!,-1
4.0,A bit hard to follow at times but Nolan delivers another amazing film.,1
5.0,Great movie but very confusing at parts.,1
3.0,"Extremely convoluted story line Main actor gives a cardboard performance Visuals are great, rest of the cast outstanding",0

2.0,"Too loud, unintelligible, and confusing.",-1
3.0,Very cleverly written storyline. There were just too many twists to be believable for me.,0
5.0,"confusing, frustrating, fresh and awesome. I didn't want it to end, what a rush. I loved all the characters. Really a great movie.",1
5.0,So good! A movie that I will watch 100x over and discover something new about it each time. The soundtrack is incredible!,1
3.0,"Just an updated ""James Bond, 007""..",0
4.0,I could tell it was a good movie but I‚Äôm unable to identify why. I‚Äôll need to see it a couple more times but I don‚Äôt think I have the energy to commit.,1
5.0,Its was a great movie. Have an open mind and just enjoy it for what it is.,1
5.0,HIGHLY CONFUSED BUT I GET IT COMPLETELY!!!! 10/10,1
5.0,It is a thinking movie that is an absolute masterpiece came out and started theorizing immediately with my friends and talked for hours about it.,1
5.0,"It‚Äôs hard to keep track of everything the first time, but it still has action sequences which will keep you grinning, and added to the aha! Moments as you piece the story together. See it with others, as you‚Äôll want to have someone to talk to. I‚Äôve seen it twice now, it got better the second time and l‚Äôm fully wanting to hit it a third time.",1
4.0,"Complex plot which at times is hard to follow, but ultimately everything makes sense in the end. Well acted and directed.",1
5.0,best movie of 2020. watched it 2x,1
5.0,Christopher Nolan is the best film maker out there right now.,1
4.0,"It‚Äôs a good movie, just confusing read the synopsis after you watch it lol",1
3.0,The storyline was too confusing to follow. It was difficult to hear the dialogue therefore making the scenes too disjointed.,0
2.5,The movie was interesting but too much talking and less action.,-1
4.0,"Liked the whole movie although it was confusing at times or too hard to hear the people speaking because of how loud the sfx noises were, which made it even more confusing.",1
4.0,"Loved the action, the language had me a little confused!",1
2.5,I couldn‚Äôt figure out the plot.,-1
1.0,That was the biggest waste of time in watching! The plot was horrible and the flow of the storyline was strenuous at best! The audio of the actors was horrendous and garbled & mumbling. I could not understand a thing they were saying or trying to portray. I gave it one star only because I can't give a negative score on stars.,-1
5.0,Loved it! I really enjoy Christopher Nolan films!!,1
2.0,Good action...but got lost following storyline from early in the beginning,-1

4.0,"Very well thought out, and tons of exciting action. It‚Äôs a very unique bend on time travel and quantum physics. Loved this movie. For the here and now watcher, could be a bit hard to follow. Might need to watch twice, and that would be well worth it.",1
1.0,It was a really weird movie that made no sense :(,-1
5.0,Fresh storyline. Great action,1
3.0,Unnecessarily too long,0
4.0,Great movie. Maybe I was too tired or it sucked watching in Quarantine with no popcorn cause I was having a hard time keeping up with the lingo. But once I saw what was going on it made sense. The actor was like a Black version of Mission Impossible. Did great in fight scenes.,1
5.0,Exhilarating and complex! Unusually technological yet user friendly! A masterpiece!,1
5.0,I absolutely loved it!!!,1
1.0,hard to understand and too long,-1
5.0,The greatest movie ever way better than The New Mutants don‚Äôt let the naysayers deter you,1
3.5,"Good story. Action packed. Was a great start, but a little confusing toward the end when they went back in time. Hard to understand what was going on and where the characters were in time.",0
4.0,It was pretty mind boggling...so mind boggling that I didnt understand what was going on until the end. Really enjoyed it for that reason. I think I would have given it 5 stars if I had been able to understand everyone speaking better. I look forward to watching it again.,1
4.5,This is so different I want to watch it again.,1
4.0,"Pay attention and try to maintain focus on this mind bending thriller, you'll still leave asking questions...",1

4.0,liked all the action in it. it started right from the beginning. if you don't pay attention you could get lost.,1
5.0,"Complicated, action-packed, and an overall visual spectacle. I don't know about you, but it tingled all the right spots. Nolan remains a genius screenwriter. Tenet is but another exhibit of evidence.",1

1.0,"Dozing off half way through, worst movie seen in 1-2 years.",-1
4.5,"A real on the edge of your seat type of movie! At times tough to follow but in a good way, that makes you want to see it again. John David Washington had a few comedic adlibs which makes the movie open to different audiences.",1
3.0,"Plot was a lot to follow. Easy to get lost. Action is good, will have to read some reviews to get the full plot explanation. One other thing the lead could potentially be Black Panther's replacement depending on how he screen test.",0
1.5,Did not like the reverse parts and a bit super loud towards the end the fighting didnt know who was who,-1
2.0,It was very confusing!,-1

5.0,A breath of fresh air in this era of retread films. Complicated but well done sit back and enjoy the ride!,1
4.5,"Interesting, great acting. So confusing-loved it!",1
2.0,"Tenet had loads of potential brilliant cinematography meets solid acting meets some compelling character arcs meets an interesting, if too-obviously Zimmer-derivative, score. But ultimately, I couldn't enjoy it as much as I would have liked because it fails as both a cerebral film and as an action thriller. The plot is too convoluted to enjoy the action, and the action takes up so much time (with not enough engaging dialogue or calmer narrative moments to balance things out) that I don't even know what to make of the plot, much less whether it had any deeper didactic meaning or purpose. If you're a die-hard Dark Knight Trilogy or Inception fan, this may resonate with you. If you found such films (particularly Inception) off-putting, you should safe yourself the time, money, and COVID-catching risk of watching this film. Choose your favorite Bond or MCU flick instead they pack about as much intelligence, but have far more to offer as far as raw entertainment goes.",-1
5.0,So intense both mentally and visually. You'll be trying to put together the movie in your head for days. Must see!!,1
5.0,"Exciting, mind-bending adventure. Christopher Nolan does it again",1
3.0,"Too long, hard to follow, if the logic made any sense",0
3.5,"It was creative yet so difficult to follow you felt lost through the entire movie. The music was interesting, also different and creative. They relied heavily on the music and sound effects. It is definitely a science fiction movie with many unreal scenes that were very well done. It was really trying to understand what was going on and actually ""Tenet"" had little to do with the movie.",0
3.5,"The plot was the most complicated of any movie I think I've ever seen...but needlessly complicated. I tried really hard to pay attention and still did not follow about half of it. --The dialog masked by masks, nearby sounds and loud music made it VERY DIFFICULT to follow what was said..... Very slick production and generally good acting...but needed a continuity clean up....and dialog was very difficult to follow. I liked Inception more.............",0
4.0,Everything was pretty entertaining just a few scenes that had noticeable CGI and I didnt really feel for the characters much.,1
5.0,Very good movie and mind bending Christopher Nolan did an amazing job and Robert Patterson as well as John David Washington,1
2.0,Confusing plot from beginning to end.,-1

5.0,Frigging mindblowing stuff!! Would totally recommend for anyone looking for a challenging movie!,1
2.0,"Very confusing and inconsistent, the movie didnt even follow its own rules.",-1
4.0,Mind bending in the best way. Major complaint was the sound editing. All the voice overs were muted and difficult to hear. The music and action scenes were over volumed to the point of hurting my ears at times. Hopefully they will re-edit the sound before streaming platforms take it on. But worth the adventure.,1
3.5,"Decent movie overall, a little unnecessarily complicated though. The dialogue in some parts of the movie is hard to hear because of the background music and noise. Worth watching but I would suggest watching from home with subtitles.",0
3.0,Not entirely sure what this movie is about.,0
5.0,I loved it! What beautiful actors and actress!,1
3.0,This movie wasn't bad or good. Too much back and forth. Good action and acting though.,0

5.0,"Lots of activity in this movie, and it definitely requires you to pay attention for the entire movie or you‚Äôll miss something!",1
5.0,I like the African American protagonist and I wish he had more African Americans in the supporting cast. The movie was fast paced and full of action. The loud level of volume may be upsetting to some people who are sensitive. Otherwise a fun film to watch and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.,1
5.0,"People say that the movie was complicated, which is true, no doubt. But if you ‚Äúfeel it‚Äù instead of thinking it, you‚Äôll enjoy the movie more. This is one of Nolan‚Äôs most craziest, coolest and visually pleasing movie that i‚Äôve seen, and it definitely blew my mind, 100% Recommend",1

0.5,Hard to follow. Very confusing. Didnt like,-1
5.0,it was like anytime time travel do-over movie meets Call of Duty action killing explosions is pretty good give it two thumbs up. once you start getting cards the middle to the end of the movie that you start piecing everything together which is pretty cool I got kind of confused a little bit but other than that I figured it out at the end of the awesome movie,1
4.0,"Pretty good movie! I didn't understand any of it, but then I also feel like I grasp the idea of it?...Now even I am confusing myself. Worth watching if you feel inclined to!üëç",1
5.0,"To give you an idea of what I thought of this film... I had to pee in the first 20 minutes, but could leave my seat for the remainder of the film. Phenomenal. Kept you guessing and holding your breath the entire time. I am ready to see it again!",1

4.5,"Christopher Nolan's unique story and effects are mind bending to the very end. Every detail is important and unique, no matter how small. IMAX envelopes you with very loud high end and low end effects and a screen to take up your entire vision.",1
5.0,It was an amazing movie. I enjoyed coming back to the movies,1
5.0,"Absolutely brilliant movie. So many layers and surprises to experience. Very well thought out and excellent attention to detail. This movie was a whole other level beyond ""Inception"". Very excited to rewatch this one to further appreciate all the subtle connections I missed in the first viewing.",1

1.5,Was very long and born,-1
5.0,"A must see experience IN THE THEATER!! As a fan of Christopher Nolan we couldn't wait to see this movie. It is complex, loud, inventive and mind-blowing. We loved the suspense and action. It was creative and thought-provoking. You will need to see it more than once. Don't try to figure it out on the first try-- or ever. Just enjoy the experience and creativity!! Loved it!",1
5.0,"Love Christopher Nolans movies. This was on the same plane as Inception: thought provoking, action, and one you have to pay attention to. Some may not like how it is not linear but that is the nature of a movie that involves moving through time.",1
5.0,"Started slow but great movie, pay close attention to the dialogue its very important.",1
5.0,"Amazing,edge of your seat movie",1
5.0,"Movie was fire, Washington and Pattinson were great together, and the storyline and cinematography were stellar.",1
3.5,"I had to follow along with the plot on Wikipedia because I couldn't understand what they were saying half the time due to muffled dialog, but it was a fun movie otherwise. As usual, Nolan delivered a 180 minute spectacle that will keep you engaged throughout. Looking forward to his next movie.",0
5.0,Truly remarkable movie. Nolan delivered for me again: intriguing and well filmed.,1
5.0,Loved it. Always great movies from this guy. This is another good one. It‚Äôs deep. Hang with it through the beginning till the end. This could prove to be a very important movie. Who knows.,1

4.5,Very interesting new concept! It was exciting and fun to watch!!!,1
0.5,"This was the most confusing movie I've seen in my life. And some of the action scenes were completely unconvincing, especially the ones involving hand to hand combat. Much of the movie was really monotonous, as scenes were replayed over again.",-1
5.0,Top notch big budget film-making. The RPX sound-system left me as shook up as the storylines.,1
3.0,Almost Needed closed captioning at times. Sound effects/ music music too loud. Good premise.,0
5.0,"this movie is fantastic but I think only a select group of people will feel that way. anyone who doesn't already process abstract thoughts on a regular basis may find this movie to be too much. people who found inception confusing will have a headache after this one. the writing was brilliant, the layering was excellent. the acting and action was great. I can't wait to go watch the movie again and really dive into the details",1
2.0,Very confusing movie about time bending that has no linear plot whatsoever!,-1
5.0,Loved the story... I keep finding new things every tome I see it... this was my second time!!!!,1
1.5,"The sound quality was bad, The plot of the movie was very difficult to follow.",-1
5.0,I loved this movie! It was pretty confusing but I thought the ending really tied up some loose ends. I look forward to this coming out on streaming so I can watch it again.,1
5.0,Nolan‚Äôs masterpiece!!,1
5.0,Great thriller! Very entertaining!,1
5.0,Very well done and a fun watch! It was predictable. but I consider that a good thing because it did a pretty good job of setting up the rules and sticking to them.,1
4.0,"TENET is so f***n complex that, present me who has watched it now can discuss and confuse the future me who has watched it thrice and thinks that he has understood it...",1
5.0,Great movie. Just like inception but better.,1
4.0,"Complicated movie, but worth the ride.",1
5.0,Mind blowing!!!! A must watch and a must own!!!,1
5.0,Best movie in 10 years,1
2.0,"Great effort, really questionable execution. Although I did like all of the actors and the acting, cool locations in costume, but the complexity of the plot line was just too much to bear for three hours",-1
4.5,Great movie. A lot of action,1
3.0,Cool concept and well executed. But also confusing and I thought that the ending could have been more dramatic,0
4.5,TENET is very long and confusing but its spectacle is worth seeing on the big screen.,1
3.0,"This was one of the most difficult movies to follow along with EVER. My head hurt for 2 days trying to piece everything together. Great concept but Geez, the flashbacks and rewinds were pretty hard to follow. They didn‚Äôt need to make it SO convoluted!",0
4.0,Lots of action and mystery! However it was hard to follow the story line.,1
4.5,"Finally, a film with a new approach to time-manipulation. Thoroughly enjoyable, but you have to pay attention. I can definitely at least one, if not two prequel or sequel movies stemming from this one.",1
5.0,The screen was amazing but the SOUND was phenomenal!,1
4.0,Confusing but enjoyable.,1
4.5,pretty good movie. just pay attention. a lot is going on like inception or something like that. wasn't sure if it was gonna be good but I really liked it,1
5.0,10/10 would recommend TENET to be seen in IMAX! Great movie!!!! It reminds me of watching my first Bond film as a kid.,1
5.0,Christopher Nolan kills it AGAIN!,1
4.0,It was Intriguing Thrilling with Breathtaking Cinematography. It Was also Sometimes Hard to follow the Scenes and Dialogue. It was Overall a Great Movie.,1
4.0,"This is a must se for 'Nolan' fans. It's definitely a thinking movie, not necessarily an action movie. The story is told is a wonderfully unique style. We saw it in 4DX, so the viewing experience was for sure enhanced. The concept of time manipulation was well explained, buuuut you will have to see it multiple times to capture the full spectrum.",1
0.5,"It was so loud that it hurt our ears. It also didn't make sense, it was stupid.",-1
5.0,Fabulous! Christopher Nolan never disappoints,1
5.0,amazing piece of art. going to watch it a second time,1
4.0,Fast moving action that keeps you on your toes following the twists in plot and the applied science you‚Äôre trying to understand.,1
4.0,A little hard to follow. I wish they would have slowed down a bit to really explain and then kept going. Funny thing is. I'll see it again so I can catch everything I missed.,1
4.0,this is a good sci-fi movie but it was sorta hard to get the flow - once I understood the story line it was really intense. the ending was the best,1
5.0,I like everything about the movie the music was excellent.,1
1.0,"This was My first movie since the theaters were closed down. I have to say, I would rather spend 6 more months in lockdown and contract AIDS than watch this garbage again.",-1
5.0,Loved it. ‚ÄúA puzzle wrapped inside an enigma.‚Äù,1
5.0,"This is one of those movies that I will need to see again, as the plot is complex and you only grasp what has happened at the end of the film. Great cast, incredible live action sequences, and mind twisting story.",1
4.5,"Great story, well acted, clever...but the sound is really difficult - often the words were muffled or muted due tot he sound effects making parts of the story hard to follow",1
4.0,it took me awhile to get what was going on in the movie there is a lot going on in this movie the stunts for great in the story line is really cool I'm pretty sure I'm going to need to see it a second time but that's okay cuz I'm going to want to,1

5.0,very interesting movie. still confused about how it all worked. which is why it's good.,1
4.5,Interesting and definitely outside of the box type of movie. I enjoyed it!,1
2.5,"Tenet was much too confusing. I don't want to work that hard to understand a movie, I'd rather be able to relax and enjoy.",-1
5.0,"Excellent movie, what you'd expect from a Chris Nolan flick.",1
3.0,"The movie started out at a blistering pace, great substance and premise.....it went downhill shortly thereafter. It picked up towards the end but I feel that a good thirty to forty minutes of unneeded script could have been done away with and the movie would have had a stronger impact, and alleviate the urge to nap.",0
0.5,I just didn‚Äôt like the movie was ver confusing,-1
3.5,"Do not get tipsy, drunk or high before seeing this movie. You will need your fully functioning brain. Lots of action too.",0
1.0,The dialogue is very hard to understand with the loud noice in the movie. Need to watch it again on streaming with subtitles.,-1
4.0,"You really have to be wanting to think to follow this one! On the one hand, it's really engaging and original. On the other hand, it moves so fast with new information that it can be really hard to follow. I was laser-focused and still didn't quite get a lot of it. Overall, it was a great way to spend 2.5 hours (I appreciated the length!) in just focusing on anything other than real life in 2020. It also sparked a new layer for a novel I'm writing, so... yeah. I really like it! But maybe it would take 5-6 hours to make it a pace I can fully comprehend.... I would be happy to watch a longer version! )",1
3.0,Plot too complicated. Overreaching.,0
4.0,"It was pretty good, I was confused for the most part",1
0.5,"Super confusing and just went on and on. I still could not tell you exactly what it is about. Just a bad movie. I gave it 2 stars because I hung in and did not walk out, but I wanted to so bad.",-1
5.0,It's very loud but interesting to watch and understand.,1
5.0,Great movie. Glad I chose imax to view it. I,1
5.0,"My husband and I loved this movie! We knew we would probably love it because it looked amazing and well, Christopher Nolan, and man we were not disappointed. The action sequences were second to none and the fight choreography was exceptional. My only critique was not enough female power onscreen, 3 supporting roles, but they could have done more with them in my opinion. Overall, a must see, and I'm proud to say it was our first movie back in theaters since the pandemic. I wanted it to be a special one, and it was.",1
3.0,"It would have been a good movie but there was ALWAYS music was playing even while the actors were talking and the music was VERY OFTEN too loud and distracting. Overall an interesting plot and twists but every time I was getting wrapped up in the movie, what should have been subtle background music would blare over the actors voices and remind me it was just a movie.",0

5.0,"After so much time spent away from the movie theaters, I‚Äôm so happy that this was the first (new) movie I saw upon their reopening. It was so nice to see something that reminded me of what I love about the theater experience. The action, creativity, acting, score, sound: all of that was top-notch in my opinion. As a massive fan of Nolan‚Äôs work with having seen all but his very first film, I can say that this is the most Nolan movie he‚Äôs ever made. All of his stylistic choices and persisting themes are very much present, so if you like the particulars of his movie, I would think that you‚Äôll come away from Tenet at least satisfied.",1
3.0,I liked Robert Pattinson and the lead actor. It is interesting to watch but it was like Interstellar way too much going on. Nolan is amazing but this and Interstellar are more than thinkers it‚Äôs like to follow it you need to study for a test to get it. It‚Äôs like cramming for a final and you get overload.,0
4.0,Good movie overall a little hard to follow certain parts of the plot.,1

I love when a movie shows me things done on screen that I‚Äôve never seen done before, and this movie has visuals that I never even imagined possible. This is a must see for anyone who enjoys films on a technical level.",1
1.0,"Great visuals, great acting. However the story line was so confusing I felt like I needed a translator! Maybe if you have a higher IQ than me youd fare better.",-1
5.0,I freaken loved it!!!,1

5.0,robert pattinson was awesome!,1
5.0,"It was our first time at the movies this year and this movie did not disappoint! It was a nonstop thrill ride right from the beginning! It is a movie that you have to pay attention to and requires you to think, which made it even more interesting! I had no problem understanding it as others have said. Also, there were no sound issues for us or trouble hearing any of the conversations. I will definitely watch this one again.",1
5.0,"This movie is all about the cinematic experience when it comes to visuals and sound. I'll admit the story is a bit complicated but it is a great movie and worth watching a few more times. There are not many directors like Christopher Nolan nowadays who can create such a movie. Don't try too hard to understand it, just let the movie unfold. In my opinion, this is one of the best action movies I have ever seen as far as the story and the stunts. This film inspires me as a film fanatic and makes me want to pursue a career in the film industry.",1

There were lessons to be taught like dont be afraid to go on adventures and its important to help others, but you were not beat over the head with those ideas. The three of us laughed at many many places in the movie and the characters were so much fun. I hope they do a sequel unless this is already a sequel and we missed it. I highly recommend it. No profanity no awkward situations. Just a fun movie.",1

3.5,"Migration is probably not going to win any major awards, but my 22-year-old daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It has everything you would want in a family movie: action, adventure, humor, and a wholesome message about families sticking together through good times and bad, to help see each other through. There was also a humorous short video that played prior to the start of Migration that followed Vector (the villain from Despicable Me) and his attempts to get back to earth from being stranded on the moon (I recommend watching Despicable Me, although, the short does a good job of explaining how Vector got there in the first place). But I digress...I wish we would have seen Migration in 3D, as there seems to be a lot of opportunities for that format to shine (lots of flying sequences). Overall, a very cute and fun (but somewhat predictable) movie. It's definitely one the young (and old) kiddos will enjoy!",0

Then, they transitioned the story into a typical Ratatouille and Chicken Run screen play/ story (if you know, then you know). It's upsetting based on the end scenes they showed.

2.5,"Just about all the jokes are pretty much ripped strait out of Looney Tunes. For kids this is great, for adults, meh.",-1
3.5,"A lot more culturally based than I had expected, but not in a bad way. There were many directorial decisions that I was a fan of, but certainly a few I thought were too far out there. There were many deeper messages that I enjoyed delving into with the people I watched the movie with once we were done. Overall, it was a very solid movie that I would recommend to others.",0
1.0,"I like Dev Patel, he's a great actor and seems like a good director but this movie sucks. I fell asleep twice.",-1
5.0,"One of the best action flicks I've seen in years! Little bit of John Wick, Ong-Bak, and The Raid rolled up into one movie.",1

5.0,"This movie was brilliant. The narrative was well written with great pacing. Dev Patel really shone through. I felt excited, sad and angry all at one time and thoroughly enjoyed the film. It definitely left me feeling as though I had a lot to think about in life. This is a must see!",1
4.0,"Great Action Scenes. In an era where we are accustomed to crazy scenes, this movie has some unique fight sequences.",1
2.0,Pretty much an Indian vengeance movie. Completely emerged in Indian religious philosophy. Action comes very late in the movie. Hardly in genre of John Wick or other more notable action movies.,-1
5.0,Excellent Action Ride for Vengeance,1
3.0,"Beautifully filmed. I didn't mind the violence, but the overall tone of the movie was relentlessly negative. That may be appropriate for a movie about revenging your mother's death, but it's also depressing.",0
2.0,All the good spots are in the trailer and the movie lags until the last 45 min of where all the action is wait till dvd,-1
5.0,Great cinematic affects and must see movie !,1
5.0,Wow that was a fun time.,1
4.0,I like the story line and the performance of the mother and mentor,1

5.0,my wife and I enjoyed the movie and had more action than we expected. also showed some cool parts of Indian culture.,1
5.0,"This movie literally is a BEAST! I just found my new action hero in Dev Patel! For this being his directorial debut, written and starred in leaves me speechless and brimming with pride! I loved every minute of this movie and cannot say enough. I hope he gets heaped with accolades wherever they may be. The depth within which he builds this character and his backstory is wonderful. I laughed, cried and rooted for him throughout the entire movie. KUDOS! It may not get recognition here in the States but it's going into my favorites collection as a keeper :) Well DONE!",1
5.0,This movie is so bad ass it‚Äôs unbelievable.,1
3.5,"I thought it was going to be a ripoff of John Wick, however it was far from it! To my surprise it was very intertaining.",0

5.0,I really like this movie action scenes are awesome & more intense,1
5.0,"Great movie, competes pretty well with the first Jon Wick movie",1
4.0,Great movie but story line lacked sense.,1
5.0,Indian John Wick with more backstory. Great movie.,1
3.5,Absolutely nailed the action. I think the plot was put on the backseat a little too much. I wish I knew what motivated Kid a lot sooner.,0
5.0,"An action movie with heart. Poignant and beautiful, with over the top outrageous action sequences!",1

5.0,"If you like action movies this movie is action packed, it also has a few comedic moments. It is a all around well rounded and well put together cohesive movie.",1
5.0,"Honestly, this movie was amazing. I cant recall the last time Ive seen a movie in the theatre and thought I cant wait to buy this. The plot isnt super intricate, the villain arc is non-existent, and the character development isnt really there for Bobby, but what this movie does it does well. Seriously, this was a sleeper movie.",1
0.5,Horrible. Thought about walking out several times throughout the movie. The action is mediocre and the story is terrible.,-1
3.0,Character development was kind of slow. The characters rehab and newfound killing abilities were not really properly flushed out. The ending left much to be desired imo...,0
4.0,"Great action, loved the plot.",1
4.0,"Not quite John Wick, but a contender nonetheless.",1
5.0,Well directed and fast paced.,1
5.0,This was a great movie! I enjoyed it very much!,1
3.5,"It was quite a movie. Lot of things happening, lot of social issues pointed out but not overly done. could have made this into a miniseries with how much content they tried to fit into a movie.",0
0.5,"This is possibly the worst movie I have watched in the last ten years. I was so bored, and the storyline just sucked. It put me and my son to sleep. I regret the two hours I spent at the movie theater, I wish I could get my money back",-1
4.5,Great movie! I would recommend seeing it!,1
5.0,Great movie with great action and acting,1

5.0,"Freaking sick, my guy! Dev Patel was incredible both behind and in front of the camera. Great!",1
5.0,Absolutely brilliant.,1
3.5,This one was a good combination of action with a good story. I was waiting throughout the show to get answers to certain events that happened early on. 3 of us went to this one and we all thought it was worth seeing. Better than the average show for sure !,0
5.0,This movie was beautifully done from start to finish. The visuals were stylish and had the perfect soundtrack. The action was fast paced and gritty. The writing was superb. I didn't hear any worn out one liners. I hope this movie and main character win several awards. This is a must see!,1
5.0,Good plot. Extreme action. Shubham Wick,1
2.5,Decent but it borrowed too much from other movies.,-1
5.0,Love the movie! The action and emotion all there . This guy deserves the love,1
3.0,"Since I don't know India's culture it was a bit hard to follow and, although it was in English most of the time, it was hard to understand what they were saying with their accents. The fighting was cool but that's about it. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.",0
4.5,The story line was a bit basic but the action was insane. Overall it was a great movie.,1
5.0,Action packed and a good story,1

5.0,"The story line. Great movie. It had everything Action, Drama, Romance and cliffhangers",1
5.0,what an amazing movie with a nice message. follow it closely and you will see. Must watch,1
5.0,"Brutal, beautiful and bold. At times, dizzying, so the stretches of calm were welcome. Dev Patel does a fantastic job as the lead and director. The making of this movie has its own rollercoaster journey and it almost didn't make it to theaters which makes you appreciate everyone involved for not giving up. Bravo!",1
2.5,The movie does a poor job of setting up the audience at the beginning of the movie to care about the character and understand his motivations for seeking revenge. It's explained in the second half of the movie but it's too little too late and slows down the movie when it should be picking up.,-1
4.0,I love gritty revenge-action movies. This reminded me of a Guy Ritchie film. And a deeper Jason Statham (who I love) action movie. Except a Jason movie on a little bit of acid and meth. It was wild and I loved it.,1
5.0,"Great directorial debut! Loved the culture, storyline, action and acting.",1
4.0,"It was good, i liked the last fight scene",1
4.5,"Acting was good, action was entertaining. A little too bloody.",1
5.0,awesome friggin movie !,1
3.5,Its an odd film in some ways but never less than interesting. Dev Patel gives his all to every aspect of the film. The only thing that put me off was the shooting style was always chaotic and the camera needed to pull back at times. There were so many quick cuts. Reminded me of Michael Bays shooting style but slightly more coherent.,0
5.0,This was something else.,1
5.0,"Well, I could tell by the Trailers that it would be extremely well shot, expertly choreographed, brilliantly directed, expertly produced - with superior acting. It did not disappoint. So visceral, beautiful, ugly, passionate, heart-felt, violent - and Bloody Entertaining! What a remarkable directorial debut from Dev Patel. Of course I'll see it again! Bravo!",1
5.0,Most violent movie I have ever seen but incredible story,1
4.0,Great Action And Vivid Story Line Of Poverty Stricken People in India,1
4.5,Shaky can was a bit excessive in some of the later fight scenes for my taste but very good directorial debut for Patel!!! Huge fan of his and I absolutely enjoyed it!,1
3.5,"It's basically John Wick on steroids. You either like this kind of film or you don't. There's no reason to discuss nuances or subtle plot lines. You go for the violence and action sequences, and Deve Patel deivers on both",0
3.5,Classic revenge type film,0
5.0,"It was a great movie, I enjoyed learning the lore and the action sequences were amazing.",1
4.0,"Dev Patel crushes it with his directorial debut. While there are some aspects here that reek of ""first time feature"" and pacing may feel a bit long in the middle, I really was invested in the journey this character went in this movie. The action is pretty great and overall I really did feel the effort and passion that went into this. Also, it has a very cool and unique soundtrack. Dev should be proud of the movie he made which I feel will resonate with many people. Feels like the beginning of something very grand. Really good movie.",1
5.0,I think this movie was an absolute masterpiece. Raw and unpredictable. Felt totally rooted in reality.,1
4.0,"The movie had a great feel and action to it. The first half was good. The second half was kind of dragging to my liking. But overall, good movie, great producers, and great directing.",1
4.0,"#MonkeyMan mainly struggles by having a shaky directing style and a story that's a bit all over the place, but this movie was still a thrill ride! Dev Patel did a fantastic job managing the story the best he could, besides its flaws, and choreographing the action! It's BONKERS!! This is the movie that I wanted John Wick to be. Patel knew what he was doing with this one, and he succeeded to the max! The build up to each fight is intense, and the rage you see in this character is horrifying. 4/5",1
3.5,"Very slow start, but had good finish.",0
2.5,The slumdog millionaire of John Wick and Equalizer. Totally played out and unnecessary.,-1
4.0,I enjoyed the movie. Thought it had a great story to it. There was plenty of action to keep it moving along. I kinda of thought of it like a different version of John Wick with the revenge of who did him & his Mom wrong.,1
5.0,it was a very good movie with a very strange ending that had you wondering if there's going to be a part two,1
3.5,"Exciting scenery, good acting by Dev Patel, somewhat hard to follow plot line",0
3.0,I love Dev Patel and I loved that this was filmed in India. The plot was captivating but the extreme violence was too much for me. I had a headache in the theater from the onslaught of one painful death after another.,0
3.5,"Solid story, great action scenes",0
5.0,Great movie! Loved the storyline and action scenes. Proud of Dev Patels director debut.,1
5.0,"If you crave your action grounded in gritty realism, with a hefty dose of social commentary, ""Monkey Man"" won't disappoint. Dev Patel the filmmaker emerges as a force to be reckoned with, and his journey of vengeance will stay with you.",1
5.0,Great movie full of action!,1
5.0,10/10 - masterpiece. That is all.,1
5.0,"Great action adventure, movie how do you recommend people to see it?",1

5.0,Fantastic movie. So many great little details too. Do not miss this!!,1
3.0,The acting was superb and the story line was interesting and unique. However the violence and gory fighting scenes were too much for me.,0
1.0,The movie was too dark and shot to close for a action flick I had a hard time keeping track of the plot due the the Indian accented english Save your money one of the worst films Ive ever seen,-1
2.0,I will never get back those 2 hours!! Don't waste your time,-1

4.0,"I enjoyed the movie so much and although there were parts that were a bit predictable, I enjoyed it overall.",1
4.0,It was pretty good honestly. I enjoyed watching it but it did have several scenes that were kinda boring for me but I still rate it 4 stars overall.,1
4.0,Great action and theres some good social commentary.,1
3.0,The storyline began at the end of the movie,0
1.0,"Overextended, very dark and one dimensional. Boring.",-1
2.0,was excited to watch movie but unfortunately can't recommend it. The use of shaky camera cinematography and blurry visuals almost made me nauseas. scenes that should have been 2mins long were about 8mins causing the movie to really drag on . flashback scenes were very confusing and fights were that fast camera action sequence that you can't follow. The original plan for at home release would have been best so you can pause the movie and come back to it when rested and ready for another long dose of confusion.,-1
4.0,Excelent action movie,1
5.0,"Great action movie! First of all, Dev Patel is so hot!! I love how it has culture and history. the story was good, I just wished the last fight was more dramatic and more action. Otherwise, it was good!",1
0.5,Movie was very hard to understand what was being said. Long and slow moving. Movie dragged. Very bloody and plot was unrealistic.,-1
4.0,"Little difficult to understand accents. Other than that, cool back story, good acting, and fun action",1
3.5,"Pretty solid movie, really great imagery and themes related to what's been going on in India. Fantastic action scenes almost John Wick level. Just kinda lost me on some of the religious themes. Can be hard to understand if you're not fluent in Hindi. Even with subtitles on and them speaking English a majority of the time it can be hard to understand what's being said. Still really enjoyed it. Dev Patel is a beast.",0
5.0,Only critique is overuse of the shaky cam. Other than that it's a refreshing change for what modern cinema tends to offer. Amazing what they pulled off with a low budget.,1
5.0,"An original action movie, and a refreshing one at that. Dev Patel did it. Must see.",1
4.5,Dev Patel. That‚Äôs it,1
0.5,"What in the world did I just watch?!! Wanna-be John Wick with a predictable and completely ridiculous plot. Way too long and some of the worst camera work I have ever seen, I was still dizzy even after the movie was over. The trailer for the movie was totally misleading. You dont have any feelings for the protagonist one way or the other because there is no character development. Its so unrealistic and stupid! Waste of my time and money. Btw theres no need to trash Christians for no reason! After all they do go and watch movies too!!!",-1
1.5,Kinda terrible. I get the plot but silly,-1

1.5,"Awful movie. What in the world did I just watch? Random characters, undeveloped plot‚Ä¶just awful. 1.5 stars for the action, but everything else was utterly forgettable. I should have walked out.",-1
4.5,"Wears its influences on its sleeve, but manages to feel very much like its own beast in the end. Beautiful, brutal, layered and well shot with great music choices that add to the vibe and don't distract or detract from it. You can see Dev Patel's blood, sweat and tears on every frame of this movie...mostly blood, though.",1
5.0,Great storyline rich in culture and action. Dev Patel was great with directing and acting.,1
5.0,Super slick action movie,1
1.5,two words: shaky cam,-1
5.0,It is a true action movie with good acting and directing. Best action film! Bravo Mr Patel,1
2.5,"It felt like a little bit of John Wick with a touch of The Equalizer, but it took way too long to actually become enjoyable.",-1
3.0,"good action, too long of a story. pace was like a roller coaster. great camera angels and fx",0
4.5,"Great action movie all around. I found the plot compelling, which is always a plus when you know you're going into a pure action firm. You can see bits of Peele and Patel's other works in the production and camera work. If you don't mind a little bit of gore (I didn't it find it particularly gory) it's a must see. I would gladly watch any future action movie directed by or featuring Dev Patel.",1
5.0,Lots of action and good story line.,1
1.5,Just punching a sandbag won‚Äôt make you good at fighting,-1
5.0,"Great Movie. A little slow at times, but the ending more than pays off",1
4.0,A more realistic John Wick... way to go Dev Patel.,1
3.5,I enjoyed the movie. The story was nice. I think there could‚Äôve been a better action sequence with the main antagonist but the movie had great action scenes overall. Main character did carry the movie.,0
4.5,Lot of story to tell and Patel got it done. Emotion and fitful aggression to carry him through to his goal. Some slower but important interludes.,1
3.0,It was too predictable and took to long getting to the main objective of revenging his mother.,0
5.0,Action packed. This movie kept me engaged the whole time.,1

4.5,Dev is a good actor and his dictatorial debut is really good.,1
3.0,"Very confusing, too many dark scenes, too much fighting, unreal fight scenes, I expected alot more of Dev Patel, one of my favorites. Trying to figure out the real story, kept quessing,",0
5.0,"It was an interesting revenge story about a great injustice done to a young kid, and his fellow people and how he dealt with the issue.",1
4.0,"Excellent debut. absolutely frenetic action sequences, the whole thing moves so quick, loved how much of it is literally in your face it hits so hard -just like gummy I had before dayuuum- it's a literal and figurative beast of a film bravo",1
1.0,"They didn‚Äôt let me in, and did NOT give me a refund, i was required of to bring a government issued identification card to prove I was age 17, they did not accept a school I‚Äôd or anything else.",-1
2.0,Way too much time to develop story and even when the movie culminated the story fell short. Wanted to understand the beaten man before the beating man. C-/D+,-1
2.0,Tried mixing Indian culture in an attempt to make a John Wick movie. There were moments but store was entirely too predictable,-1
5.0,Lots of action throughout,1
5.0,"Loved the movie, Great job for Patel‚Äôs directorial debut. If you like John Wick, Sisu, Nobody, The Beekeeper, Gunpowder Milkshake, IP Man, RRR, then you will like this.",1
5.0,"Unique type of film. Mixed with Hindu mythology. It was not your typical revenge film, and the storyline and screenplay were brilliant. The acting is very good in this movie as well. 5 stars. It was very violent so I would not take kids.",1

3.0,Very violent and dark but well done,0
2.5,Too much violence and blood through out the movie but bgm and action sequences are good,-1
3.5,action thriller that cuts to the chase quickly and timely. first time I watched a movie set entirely in India in theater. this intensity is much better experienced in theater,0
4.0,I like how it was Very action packed from start to finish. I thought it could have focused a little more on building the story line.,1
5.0,What a debuet for Dev Patel! You can not look away from the screen. Certainly has very violent scenes but seem appropiate to the story line.,1
4.0,raw and gritty. worth a watch on the big screen. bit of an abrupt ending but assuming that was the point.,1
5.0,"MonkeyMan is literally an amalgamation of The Big Boss, Game of Death (Bruce Lee's A Warrior's Journey), The Chinese Connection and Enter the Dragon with great steady cam John Wick action. Dev Patel deserves so much credit because he really carried this movie on his shoulders. Being the director, writer, star, producer says it's a sleepless job and he proved it so well in his directorial debut. Deep at heart it is a revenge story, but you see layers and layers through Kid's flashback which is happiness but at the same time it's loss of someone that he cared about that was dear to him. That's the catalyst to this story which then opens the door to the systematic corruption of the Indian government and law enforcement. Also what's nice about this film is Dev layer's Kid's backstory with religious symbolism and the alter ego he channels is the Indian god Hanuman which brings back to what his mother taught him. Those teachings from his mother is what he uses channel that rage, anger when he goes up against the corrupt system. What Dev Patel is doing here is by grounding the mythical story of Hanuman within the Kid character. He is also sending a precise message about absolute power corrupting absolutely that gets lost in the shuffle. In this film it's both an action and social commentary which he was able to convey really well. When it comes to Kid climbing up the ladder that's when it feels like Game of Death as he climbs up each level of the Pagoda and this case it's a private club. You do get that Bruce Lee sensibility with Kid wanting to just unleash rage and carnage since he lost his mother. It's that crazy fun ride and it leads to exposing the corruption of the elite. Dev Patel didn't want to just make a straightforward action film as he wanted to give it layers by giving attention to the people that have been ignored giving them a voice. For a first time director Dev Patel has shown he can handle pressure really well and it shows he improvised a lot when he made this film. Definitely worth the watch in my opinion.",1
4.0,slow build but action was great,1
5.0,A great revenge movie. Its John Wick on steroids!,1
5.0,Great directorial debut for Dev Patel! Action sequences and violence reminded me of The Raid movies.,1
5.0,movie is great. I just wish they would back the camera up just a pinch.,1
1.5,Extremely slow start. The last 30 minutes were the best part of the movie.,-1
4.5,"Tons of action, and good acting, and professionally written. If you liked John Wick you will like this movie.",1
5.0,"Wow. Ok. I wanted to see this movie because I love Dev Patel and this was his directorial debut. For the type of movie it is, he did a phenomenal job. A masterpiece really. Very intense. Fast-paced, action packed, very violent & bloody. But there is Beauty in it, as you shall see when you watch it. A+ on direction, acting, choreography, cinematography. Great attention to detail. So, I'm more an indie film girl, I have to say I was riveted by this film. A+ to Dev Patel!",1
5.0,Amazing cinematography and story. Thrilling and compelling. A must watch.,1
5.0,"Dev Patel is remarkable. Sometimes it is a difficult transition to take when you write, direct, produce and star in a film. He managed this seamlessly. This was the first Asian Indian film that actually had more gore and blood than the myriad others I have viewed. It was a vendetta themed film - trying to seek justice for a crime from the Monkey Man's childhood that resulted in him becoming a human punching bag for survival. It is well done and the acting by Dev Patel is superior! I was tired, but totally alert as the story and the film was tighly paced and absorbing. Jordan Peele, another great one, was also a producer on this film. Simply, IT PACKS A WALLOP against injustice and PSTD induced experience in early life that results in the actions and plot line of this wonderfully made film.",1
5.0,My girlfriend kept making noises whenever he was on the screen???,1
5.0,Dev Patel you genius!,1
5.0,"Whoa. Yes, that‚Äôs right. Arguably the most violent, bloody, and at times disturbing movie I‚Äôve ever seen. Once the action gets going, it never stops, but don‚Äôt be fooled by all the violence, there is a powerful message behind it.",1
5.0,Very interesting plot and good acting.,1
5.0,amazing . those fight scenes‚Äô the representation! loved .,1
2.0,The overall story and writing was NOT good. A very one dimensional movie.,-1
4.0,Amazing direction. With so little budget this movie has provided better movie watching experience than you know what studio. A couple of performances could be better and could have done a better job in casting.,1
3.0,"Wants to be the Indian John Wick but many of the action sequences move too fast or too dark or are out of focus or zoomed in too much that you cant really even tell whats going on. Movie also felt way too long, and didnt really have any kind of message other than revenge.",0
4.0,Beautifully shot movie.,1
5.0,I'm a sucker for movies like this.,1

3.5,"Spoiler alert. It captivated me, especially in the first half. However, it was so fast-paced, that I felt it almost should have been 20 minutes shorter. To have a really long, fast-paced film, it just felt like it dragged a bit. And once I felt like it was dragging, it got a lot more gory. I thought the story was great. The film itself was dark with John-Wick-type music. Captivating, but took too long to finish. Also, very unrealistic in the latter half. Nobody should ever have the desire or ability to seek vengeance by fighting through an army, let alone with no gun. But overall, it was decent. I was un-captivated, so to speak, in the second half, with how much blood came into play, and how long it took to conclude.",0
3.0,Good directorial debut from Dev Petal but this left more to be desired. Awesome soundtrack tho,0
5.0,The movie took my breath away the main actor was amazing in this movie.,1

2.0,Too Long And Uneventful,-1
5.0,Matt Reeves knocks it out the park.,1

5.0,one of the best Batman movies ever made,1
5.0,This is the real Batman movie we‚Äôve all been waiting for. Everyone killed their roles!,1
5.0,this movie was better than I thought and I liked that it was down to earth and feel more like the animated series. beyond the one political line that was forced into the film thr movie was great,1
4.0,a little long but very great movie,1

5.0,Brilliant film noir. The Batman was done very well,1
5.0,I loved it from beginning two end. I love comics,1
4.0,"Great movie. Great CGI and practical effects. Acting was mostly all good. Riddler I couldn‚Äôt take though. Performance needed to be reeled in a bit, it was uncomfortable whenever he would lose it. It just sounded whiny and unreal. Plot line was great. A great follow up to the Bale Batman movies. Excited to see more.",1
5.0,I like azreal batman from the knightfall saga,1
5.0,Robert Pattinson is The Batman!!! Cinematography was at its finest. Best movie of the year.,1
4.0,I love the realistic approach to Batman!,1
4.0,The world's greatest detective finally has a movie helping prove why that name is an apt one for The Batman. A well crafted and masterfully executed piece of Comic Book cinema. Only issue was the poor decision to make Selina Kyle the daughter of Carmine Falcone for some reason.,1
2.0,Not good. Long and dry.,-1
5.0,Batman goes slumming and we're all the better for it.,1
3.0,Emo Batpat vs usual nutcase villains in a bleak city where nobody would want to live,0
4.0,"Although it felt like Batman used zero stealth throughout the entire movie, he shows why he is the world's greatest detective even at the start of his journey",1
5.0,the best batman movie EVER. !!!!!,1
5.0,it was quite and big I loved it,1
5.0,Better than the dark knight?,1
1.0,Movie was to slow didn't have any excitement until the very end. Wouldn't recommend it.,-1
2.0,"meh, it was alright.",-1
5.0,"Nearly the most perfect Batman movie that is covered in the right amount of dark, gothic, neo-noir style that makes what a Batman movie should be.",1
3.0,Everybody but Robert Patterson was good. Should of found someone that could act and looked better.,0
5.0,best batman since a dark knight,1
5.0,I really enjoyed watching this movie. Robert Pattinson did a great job as Batman.,1
3.5,Not bad!!! Would definitely recommend.,0
5.0,Great film. Next to Dark Knight as te best batman movie.,1
5.0,Real life problems like crooked politicians and lots of action. The DC area should watch this movie.,1
5.0,It was a new/different take on the many versions of the Batman. Robert Pattinson did a great job as the Dark Knight. Id pay to see the movie again just to see the Batmobile! That sucker was a beast of a car and something I would imagine a Hero who's main thing is intimidation to be driving! GO SEE IT!,1
2.0,Relentless dark colors and grim themes. Confusing plot that I didn't care about. I don't think I like the Batman franchise in general.,-1
2.0,boring movie fell asleep through some of it. he is definitely not better than Ben as Batman. hopefully Ben can get a movie. definitely should not have done this one.,-1
3.0,Not bad. Solid 6.8/10,0
4.0,It‚Äôs a solid Batman movie. I enjoyed it.,1
3.0,Waaaaaaaayyyy too long! The entire climax needed to be edited out entirely.,0
5.0,Great movie villain kinda weird though,1
0.5,very disappointed with the film,-1
5.0,Nice presentation of a classic story.,1
4.0,"The most dark and gritty depiction of Gotham city by far. You can feel the city is in desperate need of a hero. I have never seen a Batman that has been so brooding and brutal on-screen before. The film is like a neo-noir superhero film and the story just sucks you in with its detective style. The entire cast did a great job with a great job with bringing these characters to life. As well as, Matt Reeve's giving the audience some great shots of the city and some cool action sequences. I really can't wait for the next chapter in this new Batman trilogy!",1
4.0,"I enjoyed this movie. I had heard a lot of negative reviews prior to viewing. This production is different than most Batman movies... much darker. Reminded me of The Crow. But overall, very enjoyable. Did not seem like a 3 hour movie to me.",1
3.0,"Everything aside from Batman and Catwoman was great. The movie would've been much better without them. Had it been limited to James Gordon solving the crime, it may have been a masterpiece.",0
5.0,Outstanding but a little long,1
5.0,One of the best Batman films ever,1
2.5,Some good stuff. Some boring stuff. 50/50 movie.,-1
4.0,"I really enjoyed this movie, mostly for its grittiness. Honestly, this is the only Batman live-action film that made me care for the man himself as well as the caped superhero persona. The approach of the film felt as fresh as a Batman story could be but manages to maintain the core of what makes it a Batman/Gotham story. I really liked it.",1
4.5,"Pace, acting & character build up. Riddler portrayal Batsuit, car chase is on par with Dark Knight if not better",1
5.0,"It's a breath of fresh air to Batman's cinematic portrayal and to filmmaking as a whole. I went in thinking ""the bar for an interesting Batman film is on the floor"" and then left the theater feeling so exhilarated and excited over a character I haven't cared about in decades. This film reignited a joy for the process of filmmaking that's been lost to me in recent years. While a number of films that gain publicity are entertaining and fun, many of them feel generally uninspired or forgettable (particularly in anything that isn't the writing or acting). The Batman stays consistent in it's themes and actually utilizes the environment to propel its story in a revivifying way. The city of Gotham actually feels like a place with a history to care about. The combination of the layers of sound and the distinctive lenses used add immensely to the mood and ambiance. The use of lighting accentuates the atmosphere and provides in tone what I usually only notice from the music composition. All of this is able to be interpreted by audiences peripherally without forcing everyone to sit through a boring exposition instead. Truly, there's so much care and thought put into the writing, sound design, cinematography, music composition, lighting and costume/set design that it's palpable. There's so much I could write an essay on it. Overall, I wish more film studios would step it up and allow the creative teams to work with more originality to achieve their own unique visions. The Batman might seem long, but it ties up a lot of its loose ends nicely and leaves the audience feeling generally satisfied. It's a good movie to watch for a casual film fan and a great one to watch for a Batman fan.",1
5.0,Loved Robert Pattinson as Batman he pulled it off well,1
4.0,"At almost three hours, it is a bit long, but we wound up enjoying it for the various elements. It is an action movie, but also a detective story with elements of suspense and romance. Robert Pattinson was a better Batman/Bruce Wayne than I'd anticipated. It wouldn't have been a bad movie, even without the Batman character but I'm a bit of a comics geek, so I enjoyed that part of it, too.",1
5.0,"Approached with a fresh set of eyes. This motion pictures applies a rhythm that may seem slow at first but justifies the growth of the character through out all of it's act's. Matt Reeve's flawlessly introduces to us in a refreshing way beloved character's from the Batman universe, in such a way that it does not feel like a repeat of past event but a telling go a new chapter. If you haven't seen it in theaters I suggest your purchase or rent the film to watch at home!",1
3.0,"Too long, action not evenly dispersed.",0
5.0,I liked how batman was presented so dull,1
4.5,"Really fantastic film. I know a lot of people are expecting a high octane, action superhero film, but The Batman brings the iconic character back to his roots as a young detective as the comics have always portrayed. It's a suspenseful thriller with a superhero lead, and it came out beautifully. Some points seem long and dragged, but every detail is worthwhile. Definitely more for the die-hard Batman comic fans, but still pleasing to those looking for a great overall movie.",1
1.5,Didn‚Äôt like anything about the movie... too long.. characters changed.. boring.. not worth watching..,-1
3.5,"The New Batman movie was definitely ""Darker"" then past ones. That being said the story line was good, character build up was OK. I would say 3.5 stars.",0
4.0,"I really liked that they went with detective Batman here, I also liked that it was a version of Batman we haven't seen before in the theaters. Some things didn't make sense to me, like the romance between him and Catwoman, felt very forced but this was overall a really good movie.",1
5.0,"They did a lot right with this Batman movie! Super dark, very realistic, detective focused, most combat realistic.",1
5.0,"Great film. Came to see it for the second time. Did not disappoint again. Once again, great pacing! The film goes by very smoothly, never drags on. Great for Batman films and movie goers. Great cast, cool action, drama and a true testament to the Batman character and mythos!",1
4.0,"so, so dark and psycho. No military workouts or tech gizmodry. Long dark encomiaic dirge.",1
5.0,very dark and dramatic..action packed,1
5.0,So fresh: Absolute Must see! MorbiusSweep you gotta be trolling,1
5.0,Robert Pattinson was awesome,1
5.0,The Batman was a very good movie. The plot was very good. Robert Pattinson put a different spin on the character. A darker spin for sure but he still stayed consistent to Batmans struggle both as a Victim and a as a hero. The characters where well developed and the music and sound also got high marks. The only criticism I have is the Cat Women mask its never been done like that before. so I did not care for it personally. But to be fair I'm a big Michelle Pfeiffer Cat Women fan. To me she will forever be the best Cat woman. Just my 2 cents,1
1.5,My name is Ashley A Egerton The Batman movie wasn‚Äôt that great i just saw. It tonight with my boyfriend,-1
5.0,"It was great! Acting, cast, cinematography, ZOE KRAVITZ! It was just awesome. Best Batman film I be ever seen. I‚Äôve seen ‚Äòem all.",1
4.0,"Liked: the Storyline, Bat-suit & Cinematography was quite great but the DISLIKE: the damn Bat-mobile‚Ä¶the tumbler in the last trilogy was awesome. Go see this movie!",1
5.0,"the best cinematic portrayal of batman EVER. the dark, depressing, nitty gritty street-level crime fighting is what batman needs, not any of this lame cosmic justice league nonsense.",1
4.0,"Really well done, good acting. Lots of action.",1
4.0,"Robert Pattinson is hot , I know , very brave of me to say",1
5.0,"Exciting, Action Filled, The best one yet!!!",1
5.0,fucking love it! :O),1

0.5,walked out after a short time----waisted our money and time!!!!,-1
5.0,Loved the sound track and cinematography. Acting was great!,1
4.0,very interesting story line,1
5.0,The movie was really good overall but was a little long. It took a long time to get to the plot of the story line.,1
3.5,"The cinematography and all the technical aspects of the movie were very good. If you prefer acting and interplay between characters, the theatrical aspect of movies, this is perhaps not for you. But it is artistic, as in the sense of pictorial art, and that is something.",0
1.5,Movie was too long Batman was too flat to be liked.,-1
1.0,"Honestly, I fell asleep through out the movie. Extremely boring. Terrible acting/low budget.",-1
5.0,The detective Batman I've always wanted.,1
2.0,"Given this story has been told so many times, I was not expecting much. I really attended to please my son. The movie was ridiculously long and could have been finalized at many points in the movie. But it lingered on. Given its 2022, they had to use words like white privilege and equity in order to fit the liberal agenda. Feel free to watch it, it might provide you joy if you prefer things like that. Good luck.",-1
4.5,"Great detective Batman! I really enjoyed seeing that side of him and doing it with the riddler was a perfect way to showcase that part of him. I enjoyed the whole movie! Cat woman needed better motives, but I enjoyed her and Batman working together more. It‚Äôs nice to see that Batman movies have not lost their touch üëçüèæ",1
3.0,The writing for Batman was not typical. Not enough action!,0
4.0,"Movie was phenomenal, but the movie theater was full of distracting, rowdy, rude people flashing their phones and making noise. Cinemark del Norte is not a great place to watch a movie for me or my family.",1
4.0,Didn‚Äôt like that they made Bruce parents have such a dark secret,1
4.5,"We have seen so many iterations of Batman over the years, yet this one stands apart with it‚Äôs grit and dark tone. Absolutely a must see if you are a fan of Batman.",1
5.0,Immersive and engaging. I came in thinking it would be OK according to reviews. I was wrong. it's better than ok. It was excellent.,1
3.5,"We saw The Batman on Tues, April 19, 2022. I liked it! The chase scenes were amazing! However, it was slow and about an hour too long! I thought the Batman costume was outstanding! But...I really wanted to see the new Batmobile, it only showed it in shadows, never up close and sitting still! My friend who was with me gave it a 2 out of 10. He thought it was boring! Oh well, to each their own!",0
5.0,"This wasnt like the usual comic book Batman. It seemed more realistic. Batman walked among the people like a real person, which he is. The plot was brilliant and all the actors were great!!",1
4.5,Loved it. Watched it a couple times. This movie displayed the detective side of Batman. Bravo.,1
5.0,a great batman movie,1
5.0,Action packed movie filled with amazing acting.,1
5.0,loved the story and all actors were great,1
3.0,"Never any consistency with Batman. Even though the movie made alot of money I believe its because we want to see it do good. The actors are good ad well as the acting. But something's is missing. There was no Wow factor in this movie. seemed like an origin story they couldn't make up there mind with. Couldn't tell if batman had any super strength abilities or just an MMA Fighter. Was he as Psycho as the villains? Had a blade feel to it, Had a Dracula feel to it. Hunting down Villians that dont have a comic feel. Movie had no true grounding. Was confusing and long. How will this batman level up with the justice league? Batman 2?",0
4.0,Strong story line but a bit long.,1
4.0,Well it was a little too long. But we ended up really liking the movie. The characters all meshed together very well.,1
5.0,RPX! Great sound quality and screen High Definition! Super comfortable seating too! Fun times!!,1
3.5,"It's a good movie, but a little derivative of The Dark Knight trilogy.",0
5.0,Rob Pattinson was perfect. Great film noir feel. A little heavy for me at times but really great.,1
4.0,Beginning was extremely slow but as movie progressed it got interesting and exciting,1
0.5,"Horrible horrible movie!!! too long, crappy acting and too woke for my family values. It was torture I had to get up several times and walk out.",-1
4.0,Very interesting take on a classic story.,1
4.5,"It was a good movie. A little different from Christopher Nolan's films, but some very similar themes, and a lot of pauses furing the high tension moments. Very good acting, and it didn't use the same level of rage in Batman as the last trio of films. I'm excited to see what the next one will have in store for us.",1
4.0,Too long. It could have had shorter scenes that had violence but loved the story and the acting.,1
2.5,Disappointed they had to make this movie about race also. Not painful but not good either.,-1
3.0,"Good movie, dark, very similar to Phoenix as the joker movie.",0
5.0,Different than others in the franchise. Relatable,1
2.5,"The movie was okay, it was shot very dark and wasn't as much action as I anticipated.",-1
4.0,"I really loved the fight scenes, I loved how the choreography behind them and the atmosphere that the film was perfectly dark enough to fit the themes of the film. My only complaint was in the length as it felt like that the movie was trying to end itself 3 times.",1
4.0,Good Origin Storyline...A Tad Dark...The Bat needed MORE gadgets.,1
2.0,Robert Pattison is the absolute worst Batman I have ever seen. I wish I could get not only my $ back but the time viewing this movie back. Michael Keaton and Val Kilmer were MUCH better as Batman.,-1
3.0,"This movie was way too long. It had interesting plot points, but I think this would have been better explored broken into two movies. I thought Pattinson was a pretty good Batman but could have maybe been a better Bruce Wayne. I do wish Selena Kyle/Catwoman had been explored a bit more as a character. It was still ultimately an enjoyable movie, but I have enjoyed certain previous Batman movies more than this one.",0
5.0,Already got me looking forward to the next one!,1
0.5,"horrible.... just horrible. this just proves there are SUCKERS out there and if you make any BATMAN movie, they'll come running regardless how BAD it is.",-1
4.5,"great score and cinematography, literally beautiful but catwoman kinda sucked and her relationship with batman seemed a bit too forced‚Ä¶",1
0.5,"Boring, slow, and not exciting at all. I know Batman is dark but this was overboard on the darkness. Did not care for Robert Pattinson as Batman. Sorry.",-1
5.0,Just a very entertaining film. Took grandsons and we all enjoyed it.,1
0.5,Worst version of batman,-1
0.5,A terribly boring movie with cheesy dialogue. I would've rather watched Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy,-1
3.0,"I fell asleep a few times, but I think they tried to cram too many characters in at once. Not enough explosions for my taste, though, I'm a huge fan of the Christian Bale movies.",0
0.5,"Trash, waste of movie. Every scene is stretched out for no reason. Pointless movie. Dont watch it.",-1
2.0,"Unnecessarily long, became boring quite early in the film.",-1
4.5,"Great movie, but for a long movie enthusiast such as myself, this movie was too long for the purpose it was serving, and that kept it from 5 stars. If you are a fan of the original Batman Detective Comics this will more speak to your taste. Not a family film.",1
4.0,Really good. Entertaining! Just a little too long.,1
4.0,It was great movie would recommend,1
5.0,Fantastic!!!!! Batman done right,1
5.0,i liked robert that‚Äôs it,1
4.0,"I went with a group to see The Batman tonight. Pretty good movie overall, but a bit long, trying to cover too much maybe. Robert Patterson was pretty good, definitely had his moments, but Zoe Kravitz did a great job with her role as Catwoman.",1
5.0,It was very suspenseful.,1
3.5,Good movie. Bruce Wayne was too emo!,0
3.0,Cristian Bale movies were better,0
5.0,Unfortunately This movie was so GAHHHH DAMMNNN AMAZING.. MY HEART WAS RACING,1
5.0,This movie gets better every time I see it!,1
2.0,It was ok but most definitely could have been better. For me it took to long for them to figure out who the riddler was and too many people died who didn't have anything to do with the crap that was going on in his mind.,-1
3.0,Not even close to the Dark Knight. Way too long.,0
1.5,Reminiscent of Twilight‚Ä¶.lots of music to cover up Robert Pattinsons acting. A lot of fight scenes are the kind you see at Universal Studios stunt shows‚Ä¶.He also cried a lot. Just wasn‚Äôt a fan,-1
4.0,"It was good, he showed a dark side to batman.",1
5.0,This was a fun comic style batman I'm curious where they plan on taking this series too next.,1
4.0,Great plot. Good acting. Excellent cinematography. Some of the writing for the lines was subpar.,1
3.0,"Movie could have been about 20 minutes shorter. However, it was an interesting and believable take on a younger Batman and Cat Woman, it was good - just too long..",0
2.0,The movie was not good. When is DC going to learn to build a universes like Marvel,-1
4.0,"Well done as a psychological thriller, dark, and Robert Pattinson did a surprisingly fantastic job in the role. Loved the tense music throughout. Assumed audience knew some of backstory of Batman and Gotham, which was ok for me but audiences not familiar might have a lot of questions.",1
5.0,"Stands tall, shoulder to shoulder with The Dark Knight.",1
5.0,something in the way,1
5.0,it got batman so right that Christian bale just failed at,1
5.0,Riddle me this what time is a charm? Answer - The Third,1
5.0,It‚Äôs a really good movie must watch,1
5.0,Good story line and Robert Pattinson actually did a good job as Batman. Watch it!,1
5.0,"Great Movie, the Batman although somewhat a dark atmosphere is not the usual old school stuff, but I really liked the plot and the action. I'll be waiting for a sequel to this movie in the future.2 thumbs up all the way.",1
5.0,"What's to dislike? This movie is incredible and I am hoping to see a sequel. I loved the casting, the suspense, the score, the art direction, and especially the Special Fx/CGI. Great plot, script . . . and the acting was great.",1
3.5,"Definitely did not feel like 3 hours. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it. Would I watch again, no. It was entertaining",0
3.0,was slow at the beginning almost walked out,0
4.0,On edge throughout the movie,1
2.0,"Was very disappointed, again DC did not make the producers of this shameful movie stick to the original ""Batman"" story. DC needs to take clues from Stan Lee and Marvel... what a waste of 64.00 (4 tix).",-1
5.0,It was freaking awesome. Loved it.,1
4.0,Only things I didn't like were: 1. How long it took to get from point to point in the story. 2. The lighting in many scenes made it too dark to see clearly Other than those it was a pretty solid movie!,1
5.0,love it! thankful they didn't mess it up felt like you Batman movie üé•üçø,1
5.0,"This is not a typical super-hero type movie. It is a total reimagining of the Batman story, but not an origin story. The villians aren't costumed like a comic book. The environment is much more authentic/real. The movie has less action per minute than some fans may appreciate, but it has a great story with colorful/realistic characters. Excellent cast throughout.",1
4.0,"Very interesting batman, a who done it . Lots of action",1
5.0,"Great movie, dark, gritty, violent with a great love story and plot line. Well done all around by the cast, crew, director, cinematographer everyone killed it... idk about (spoiler coming) the actor playing the joker at the end tho it didnt seem very natural the laugh seemed forced and weak they should definitely change that if they move on to a Joker based sequal. Other than that I loved it Pattinson, Kravitz, Dano, Serkis, Farrell and Tuturo did a great job",1
4.5,Dark yet highly entertaining. Loved it!,1
1.5,Great movie but entirely too long! Not worth sitting through. Don‚Äôt go!,-1
4.0,Entertaining. A bit too long. 3 hrs. Longer with previews.,1
5.0,One of the best DC movies since Christopher Nolan‚Äôs Dark Knight trilogy.,1
5.0,Great storyline and overall great movie.,1
5.0,Robert Battinson is the best Batman ever! He was born to play this role!,1
1.0,it was the longest most drawn out boring movies I think I've ever watched and by far the worst Batman. I'd rather watch val Kilmer and Schwarzenegger 10 times than sit through that again.,-1
5.0,Different than the other Batman Movies but the whole mysterious story line keeps you hooked on the movie,1
5.0,Awesome! It was three hours long and I stayed awake!!!! That never happens!!!!,1
4.0,"For this to be a 3hr movie, I enjoyed it. I didnt get tired or bored with the action.",1
5.0,Really liked it! They did a really good job.,1
3.0,length was from unnecessarily stretching out scenes to make them more dramatic.,0
4.0,"I may have fell asleep at 1 point, but it happens sometimes. Really enjoyed it though.",1
4.0,"Though it was 3 hours, it didnt feel that long. Some dialogue scenes were a little too obvious, but otherwise a fun time. Didnt expect to like Pattinson, but he did well.",1
3.5,A little violent for children but otherwise good.,0
4.0,"The movie was long and always raining in so many scenes. Action was okay, just a little over dramatic.",1
5.0,"A suitably dark and moody atmosphere propels Robert Battinson through this newest take on an old motif. A slow-burn noir at its heart, moments of intense action keep the pace from dragging in spite of its approximately three hour run-time.",1
1.0,Boring. Poor character development. No plot.,-1
5.0,Great movie. Robert Pattinson did a great job.,1
5.0,What a long movie but It kept you on the edge of your seat just fantastic I didn‚Äôt think that young man would make a good Batman totally blown away thank you,1
0.5,"Wack, weak, idiotic, 3 hours just to make it long and not enjoyable. If this is the #1 detective I'm Elon musk.",-1
5.0,"The most real Batman yet, even more grounded than the Nolan trilogy. They even got the physics right! So few movies are this attentive to detail. The story is an emotional one, riddled with detective work, intrigue, and insight into both Wayne's inner world, and the corruption inside Gotham. The visual storytelling is dramatic and intense as well this is a true film noir, featuring The Batman as our central detective trying to unravel the Riddler's scheme, and he learns more than he bargained for. Also the new Batmobile is badass!",1
2.0,"this movie is violent,boring, long and drawn out. When Robert Pattinson is playing batman, he is at his best! He is vengeance after all. The supporting cast is brilliant too. Zoe Kravitz and Paul Dano are outstanding! It is a good movie, but the story was all over the place. The Dark Knight is my favorite batman movie!",-1
3.0,"The movie is really dark (not brightly colored) and the story I found to be a little hard to follow. Not the best of the best, but just an ok movie.",0
5.0,"The Batman =The BadAss! Total Thrill Ride from opening scene to Ending Scene! Smart, Brooding, Dark and Witty! What a Refreshing Reboot of a Storied Franchise! DC finally is hitting on All Cylinders! The only thing Better than the introduction of The Suicide Squad! A Must See for All fans and movie goers Around the World!",1
5.0,"I didn't think I was going to enjoy it as much as I did. I was a huge fan of the Bale Batman movies and didn't think this would hold up, but I was wrong. Very well done. Robert Pattinson surprised me. I had very low expectations when he was cast, but he proved me wrong.",1
4.0,Well made movie with good performances and a suitably dark tone. Some of the action editing seemed disconnected. A number of stunts strained credibility for a hero who is mortal.,1
0.5,The story dragged out too long. Batman was too depressing.,-1
2.0,It was boring but I‚Äôm not a Batman fan. Just watched it because I figured with Zo√´ it would be good but it was still boring.,-1
4.5,"Not that bad of movie of at all, it definitely gives a different look for Robert Pattinson but do yourself a favor and don't go in expecting it to follow the same formula as other Batman movies this one has a completely different chemistry to it.",1
4.5,Excellent and Pattinson was very good.,1
1.0,The last 30 mins are the only part I liked. Was having a hard time staying awake.,-1
3.0,Ir moved too slow and was confusing at times,0
5.0,"I hate when I can anticipate the plot moves. This left me baffled! NOT your ""typical"" action/adventure, which I'm addicted to. This is far superior than ANY previous offering of the Batman group of films! Seeing it again this weekend!",1
4.0,Dramatic. Good characters.,1
1.0,No plot ... too much violence for violence sake. Dark and depressing.,-1
5.0,Honestly the movie was exceptional. I would totally watch it over again not just with friends but also with family since it‚Äôs good. I also liked the touches of the emotional aspects and dramatic aspects. Would recommend,1
3.0,Nice cinematography but too long,0
5.0,"Movie was excellent, great plot, loved the dark twist, characters were solid, acting was solid...",1

5.0,"Excellent movie. Different feel, but the quality of story telling, performances, as well as the overall production value were right up there with the Dark Knight. You never really feel like the movie is as long as it is which is a very good thing. I was very impressed and look forward to seeing more of this Batman in the future.",1
5.0,The Batman... a dark and gritty vision of what Gotham was like two years after Bruce Wayne became Vengence and took to the shadows to try and clean up the city. This is a key piece of info that's easy to miss. it's only been two years. BW hasn't developed the playboy persona of Bruce Wayne. He's a recluse. I loved this Batman... it was fantastically well portrayed. The scene with the Batmobile when it comes to life gave me chills. It was so good!!! Highly Recommend!,1
5.0,Good action and dialogue,1
3.0,"It was not one of the best batman movies,it was okay.",0
2.0,We didn't like the Batman movie but the service was wonderful.,-1
4.5,This was an interesting take on the Cape Crusader in the seems that it really focused on his Darknight Detective persona more so than any of the other iterations. Rob Pattison exceeded my expectations (which were admittedly low to begin with) and the overall action was edgy and more realistic. Colin Farrel was unrecognizable in his role,1
5.0,Quite possibly the best Super Hero movie to date!,1
2.0,"Too long. Some called it dark, I felt it was dreary. Not enough new material, pretty much rehash of old storylines, just with a creepy, horror story vibe. Weird, not fresh or original.",-1
4.0,A solid if unspectacular superhero film.,1
2.0,It rained a lot. For a long time. That's about it.,-1
4.0,"Much better than I expected, was very dramatic and takes you on a journey as Batman chases the riddler acrossed Gotham connecting the dots of the puzzle",1
5.0,This movie was exciting and captivating start to finish.,1
5.0,A close favorite in the Batman movies. Interested to see how this series will pan out.,1
5.0,"This isn't just a great Batman movie, it's a great mystery ) crime drama to boot.",1
5.0,"it was very dark, but I thought over all it was a really good film! it's a very far role from the shiny vampire RP is well know for playing.",1
4.0,A bit long and very dark... need more Bruce Wayne story - but not at the cost of more minutes. Decent audio in a relatively small theater. Can't wait to get this as a 4K movie in my home system.,1
5.0,a stellar modern batman,1
1.0,"Too dark, not easy to follow and poor performances",-1
4.0,"The darkness of Batman didnt fail, action scenes and storyline was great, long movie keeps you in your seat to the very end! Highly recommend seeing in the theater.",1
3.5,"3 1/2 stars but would have given a 4 1/2 star rating if they had cast a different actor in the role of Batman. Some considerations, Idris Elba, Colin Farrell, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt , Hugh Jackman. I don't know if anyone would agree on any of these Actors that they would be the one either. There are some big shoes to fill.",0
5.0,"A very different but perfectly valid presentation of The Batman. It has a good plot that takes the viewer along to discover the story. The visuals were well done. Lighting-wise, this is the darkest movie I've even seen without any bright scenes in the entire movie. It was good to see it in a theater instead of at home.",1
2.5,Too long. Robert Patterson played his role well but not anything exceptional. Others have done a better job.,-1
4.0,really good adaptation of the the long Halloween,1
4.0,"It was somewhat dark, different from other Batman movies.",1
1.0,Robert Pattinson comes across as an emo shrimp in the role of Batman.,-1
5.0,"This was a dark, gritty movie--as it should be! It takes place in Gotham City, a place where the sun never shines. This is early Batman--one who isn't quite sure who he is or what he should be and Pattinson portrayed it PERFECTLY. I absolutely loved the way they showed Batman before he got his stuff together. A new Batman, one without years of experience--only a passion for doing what is right. This movie is the Batman I want to see continued. Forget the others, let's see where Battinson goes...",1
3.0,Good fighting scenes when there was. Was a very slow burn movie. Could have had more action less filler.,0
4.0,It was a good movie with lots of plots interacting into one movie.,1
4.0,A very good adaptation of the Batman and other key characters of Gotham City.,1
5.0,"Kept us on the edge of our seat, from start to finish!",1
5.0,that it had one little moment with the joker!!,1
5.0,"Lots of action, great characters and you didnt want it to end",1
5.0,I have been a Batman fan for years and ket me tell you... THIS IS HOW YOU WRITE A BATMAN MOVIE!!!!! He is first and foremost a detective. This Batman is still new to crime fighting and flawed. His relationship with Gordon was right out if the comic books. I love the new direction they took Catwoman. Truly one of my favorite Batman films. I think it is just as good as The Dark Knight (2008).,1
0.5,That was 3 hours of my life I‚Äôll never get back. Worst. Movie. Ever.,-1
5.0,"Great plot, action, acting and special effects!",1
5.0,This movie is tough also i love catwoman.,1
5.0,Best set decoration and effects,1
5.0,Movie was a bit long but it was worth the time watching. Good plot for future films and character building. The Catwoman and Batman duo was pretty cool too.,1
5.0,can't wait for the next one,1
3.5,"Great cinematography and action, just lacked a succinct storyline.",0
5.0,I liked how the movie had so many different things throw at the viewers. Totally recommended.,1
3.0,"I'm giving three stars only because of Cat Woman. If Cat Woman wasn't in this movie, then this movie would suck. This movie DRAGS and we barely get any action.",0
3.0,Boring and picture was too dark,0
2.0,"It was okay, felt like I was about to fall asleep at times. Robert Pattinson couldn‚Äôt land a smash through a window to save his life. His voice barely changed from Bruce Wayne to Batman, and the eye makeup under his mask was an interesting choice. Everyone else did a great job. There wasn‚Äôt much action with his gadgets either but I guess he is going ‚Äúbroke‚Äù in it so maybe that‚Äôs why.",-1
3.0,"Not a bad movie, probably the darkest Batman yet. It seemed to drag on going nowhere sometimes but still held my interest",0
3.0,Good acting and chemistry re: Robert P and Zoe K. Movie as a whole was ho hum. Constant rain and dreariness a bit much.,0
3.0,It was okay. The Catwoman was the highlight of the movie.,0
5.0,The movie was awesome! The entire cast did a excellent job! Very Dark and very suspenseful! I can‚Äôt wait for the next one!,1
0.5,Slow could not follow way too long. They should‚Äôve got a better person to play Batman. Penguin character was stupid the Riddler character was stupid all the characters were stupid. I would not recommend ever,-1
5.0,I liked the movie. It was a unique way to do Batman that I thought was nifty.,1
2.5,Movie was ok. Not bad. Not great. Movie was ok.,-1
5.0,Best Batman movie so far. Great casting and cinematography. Definitely the most realistic and believable plot. Those expecting this to be an action packed superhero movie will be disappointed.,1
5.0,This was the best most fun movie I've seen in years. It was close to 3 hours long but it was so intense and exciting that the time flew by. I hope there will be another installment of this soon.,1
3.5,Entertaining but a little long.,0
1.0,Worse Batman movie out of all the Batman franchise movies. Out of 3hrs only 20 minutes of action. Thumbs down all around.,-1
5.0,The acting was great. I always enjoy the dark cinematic vibe of the Batman movies! Excellent writing.,1
3.5,"A lot of great action, but too long!",0
2.0,"This batman is purely for looks. Lacks anything that would make me interested to see it again or see the inevitable sequels that will follow. Fight scenes were the only highlight for an otherwise strenuous 3hr viewing. Mediocre batman, even worse Bruce wayne.",-1
1.5,"Couldn't hear dialogue, movie was too long, Robert Pattinson was a bore, Zoe Kravitz was a less sexy Halle Berry reboot.",-1
5.0,Amazing!!! Can‚Äôt wait to watch it again!,1
5.0,"I love that there was a lot of action, but there was SOOOOO much suspense! People forget that Batman is a DETECTIVE. There are many great Batnan films, but this one just may be my favorite. That's just me, though.",1
2.0,"very boring, lack of creativity zero technology",-1
5.0,It was a good movie but like some movies there were some slow parts,1
5.0,Loved the action all the way through!!!!,1
3.5,"The movie was good overall, I won't buy the DVD to re watch it but it was worth the money once",0
5.0,It was really good!!!ü•∞üòç,1
5.0,Absolutely amazing!! Must watch movie!!,1
5.0,3 hours but it kept your attention! Great movie cant wait for the next one!!,1
2.0,Unnecessarily long and boring at times.,-1
0.5,It‚Äôs not worth the hype it‚Äôs really boring not a lot of action a lot of trying to find the riddler it‚Äôs boring,-1
0.5,"The movie had too much talking and hardly no action sequences, the picture was too dark couldnt hardly see anything",-1
1.0,The actors did a great job but the movie was so slow I almost fell asleep. I dont mean to sound mean. I love these kinds of films. Just found it boring.,-1
5.0,Dark as usual but tells a great story,1
5.0,One of the best It was so good that you didnt know it was 3 hours long,1
3.5,the movie was dark and unlike the Batman I used to know.,0
2.5,I‚Äôll never get those three hours back.,-1
2.5,"It was ok, a little too long but the acting was good",-1
4.5,lots of suspense and action,1
3.5,"Great special effects! The story moves very well and it was fun for my husband and I. The new Batman suit was awesome. He was also a grittier batman. The new take on the Bat Mobile was so cool. I enjoy the incorporation of modern technology, so the movie felt current. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because my husband felt it was overly dramatic at times. I liked the dramatic moments though.",0
5.0,"LOVE LOVE this version of Batman. Can‚Äôt wait for the next one. Was unsure of Pattinson as Batman, but he won my heart! Must see!",1
3.0,"liked the darker side and a bit more on him being a detective, cinematography was good and direction, but the story and the pacing were the weak points with the undertones that were heavy handed and not subtle. good film overall but probably wouldn't hype it up or tell people they should watch it.",0
5.0,Amazing story and cinematography great movie in all,1
3.0,"Batman wasn't really batman. He just walked into buildings, never hid in the shadows. Just throwing himself into a fight not trying to take people out quietly. And Robert Patterson just isn't Batman. Batmobile was cool of courae",0
0.5,"The film was shot entirely too dark, very hard to see many of the scenes. 3 hours was entirely too long, felt they tried to fill the movie with too many characters everyone knows.",-1
4.0,To expensive for a fantasy movie,1
4.0,"Great story and didn‚Äôt rehash the intro story that‚Äôs been done so many times already. I just wish the fellow playing Batman had a little more energy when he spoke and walked. The slow walk and mumbling mixed with the bummer theme song were enough to put everyone to sleep, luckily the story, catwoman and penguin are incredible in it. See it",1
2.0,Way too dark and depressing. Not at all what I had hoped for or expected. Not worth 3 hours of your life!,-1
4.0,"Good story line, action and actors. A little long",1
5.0,The Batman was amazing. Felt like a very genuine storyline with believable backstories for the main villain. Beautiful cinematography and well scored. There needs to be a sequel.,1
3.0,"Slow , long, long. & just ok",0
5.0,Great movie! Closest to the classic Batman cartoons. Dark vibes love it,1
4.5,better the second time. pacing was Batman like so I suppose what was expected. but sometimes maybe watching Batman doesn't have to feel like swimming through a morphine haze.,1
5.0,Im in Love with all Batman movies,1
4.5,this happened to my buddy once,1
5.0,The Batman was good. Good story line and action.,1
2.5,It is very long and very dark. Batman was sullen. There was no happiness or optimism in the whole movie. Not sure it was worth the almost 20 it cost for our tickets.,-1
0.5,Horrible. Wanted to walk out.,-1
5.0,the movie was great!!! I didn't gonin there have high expectations but it surpassed them all together.,1
5.0,It's a fresh new take on The Batman. Very well executed. The cinematography was the best I've seen recently. Bravo.,1
5.0,amazingly done. didn't feel like 3 hrs at all.,1
5.0,Loved it. Pattinson can be my Batman any day.,1
2.0,Horrible acting. Super cheesy scenes. Not worth the 3 hours.,-1
5.0,It was excellent. Maybe the best Batman movie yet!,1
2.0,"Warning. The most EMO Batman I have ever experienced. First he really is very small physically. Not very imposing., hard to buy him as a bad ass he looks like he weights 150 pounds. The greasy hair and gross clothes. NOT Bruce Wayne at all. I know he is supposed to be dark and brooding but OMG! I think I will call him Prozac Batman. Terrible job by RP. I need Christian Bale or Ben Affleck or even M Keaton.",-1
5.0,One of the best movies I‚Äôve seen so far. Love the soundtrack !!!!,1
5.0,It was a great movie! Loved it!,1
2.0,"Long movie, slow and boring story line. Not much action.",-1
5.0,The sound effects and the acting,1
3.5,"A little long and Slow at times, but worth seeing .",0
5.0,Everything was amazing and awesome,1
5.0,"Amazing cinematography, great acting and writing. Music, costume, casting on point.",1
1.5,It dragged on and the story line was so hard to follow and it jumped around like crazy! There were 9 of us and we were all disappointed!,-1
5.0,was pretty good and I'm more of a marvel fan than anything but that was good,1
3.5,"Better and more engrossing than I expected. A bit slow from time to time, and unending rainy nights.",0
5.0,OMG THE CATWOMAN IS SO HOT,1
3.0,Great actors but another drawn out DC comics movie.,0
4.0,Plot too complicated.,1
5.0,It is an action packed movie. It kept me on the edge of my seat all through the movie. I highly recommend the movie.,1
5.0,"Fantastic Movie! DC needs to keep pushing with movies of this caliber. Please don't kill this off, make a sequel with this version.",1
1.0,The whole movie was terrible walked out in 30 min. Why is the vampire werewolf boy playing batMAN,-1
5.0,This movie is more realistic (if realistic is possible with a Batman movie) than other over the top Batman movies. Plot doesnt hinge on never seen before gadgets or vehicles. Kind of a working mans Batman if you will. A bit long but it answers all the questions it poses so youre only left hanging at the very end in the set up for the next installment.,1
3.0,The movie was just ‚Äúokay‚Äù to me. Robert Patterson does not scream BATMAN to me. I felt the movie tried to top the others and did not do that.,0
4.5,Really good. Being PG-13 kept it back.,1
4.0,"beautiful unique shots throughout the film, interesting update for the riddler, very forced/unnatural romantic subplot, the middle third drags with a good complex finale. interesting use of daddy Wayne lore, the gadgets were very commonplace.",1
1.0,"Too damn long. That was the only ""comic book"" movie that I chose to see, based on the previous Batman movies. It was so boring, that I fell asleep during the movie. No more ""comic book"" movies, no more cartoon movies, no more ""bang & crash"" movies. Only ""quality cinema."" And I realize that I probably will not be seeing too many more movies, but that is the price I will have to pay for trying to keep trash & stupidity out of my time & life.",-1
1.5,Movie was Bad. Too long. Some serious editing could have improved it immensely. Penguin chase scene was way too long. Broody Batman did not fly with me.,-1
3.0,"The riddler was good, but Robert Pattinson does not live up to his predecessor, Christian bale.",0
5.0,Honestly great movie,1
0.5,Didnt even watch the movie someone took our seats so we sat In front of them and they were coughing so we had to leave 30 minutes In,-1
4.5,Let‚Äôs see if Fraser can get a back to back cinematography Win.,1
3.0,"Movie was really great!!! My son and I enjoyed. Colin Farrell was not even on my radar!! He played his part well. IM still trying to process Robert Pattinson as Batman. He didn't have the swag that other actors had as Bruce Wayne...other than that still a great movie...I loved Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman, but why she just wore a black Skully as a mask? I dunno...",0
5.0,why did the shotgun hurt him?,1
4.0,This one was very well done. It was dark and twisted and showed that vengeance only begets more vengeance. I'm surprised how much I enjoyed the acting considering who was in it but it really was good acting! The atmosphere was dark and creepy. It was very good overall!,1
5.0,"Absolutely entertaining. Robert Pattinson does fantastic work as Bruce Wayne/The Batman, showcasing a gritty and extraordinary presence as one of DC's greatest heroes in comic book history. Also, the supporting cast has great chemistry that works well alongside the titular character of the film.",1
4.0,Great storyline and characters. Very long. No look into Bruce Wayne‚Äôs life‚Ä¶only Batman/Vengeance.,1
5.0,"Fresh, visually fascinating, worth the length. The action was so crisp, the lighting was mesmerizing. There was always something going on and even the slow parts weren't boring. Could watch it over and over again.",1
4.0,a bit dark in Gotham City - night always and rain. Otherwise good,1
5.0,"This is my third time seeing it and I absolutely love it, even still! Top notch acting and a LOT of TLC went into making this. Its very faithful to the comics, so hardcore fans will deem it worth sitting for three hours!",1
2.0,To dark picture. Weak story line,-1
5.0,"I loved this movie. The pacing was good and the cinematography was beautiful. I love Batman and how in the end he realizes that he needs to be more, be a symbol of hope, and bring a change to Gotham. I love Catwoman and how she realizes that she is not the only one who is an orphan and that Batman has her back. The Riddler was a really fascinating, creepy, and a genius character. It was a shock to me that he flooded Gotham with the help of Batman. Batman helped him by solving his riddles, and getting clues to where the Riddler might be. I love everything about this movie, and I would love to see this movie for a 2nd time. This is a movie I will never forget!",1
5.0,Fabulous. Rob Pattinson perfect as Batman. Zoe Kravitz also awesome. one of the best chase & crash sequences ever. Truly dark & sinister. High tension greatness.,1
5.0,10/10 must recommend,1
5.0,"If anyone loved the TV Show Gotham you will very much relate to the characters of this movie! Even though the lighting could have been brighter, the darkness and grey tones of the movie define how evil the gangs and drug lords of this city are.",1
2.0,Not impressed! 3 hours wasted! Never checked my watch that often.,-1
5.0,Definite must see!! Bust modern Batman movie made in the last 20 years!!!,1
4.5,I would say it's up there with Dark Knight and Patterson did a great job. They really nailed the Riddler. Some of the language is a little raunchy but then again it's darker themed so I'm not surprised.,1
5.0,Great job by DC and the actors! Dark and gritty but also kept you interested. Can‚Äôt wait for the follow-up!,1
5.0,Robert Pattenson made a good batman. I like how they changed Bruce Wayne's storyline.,1
5.0,Good movie a lot of detail with his family,1
5.0,Great Movie! Great acting and in deep meaning for the characters and there deep motives. Would definitely recommend.,1
3.5,Different pov of Batman but I enjoyed it.,0
4.5,The only thing I didn't like about it was how long this movie was. With that being said the movie was really well paced and kept me entertained for the 3 hour run time.,1
1.0,What the hell was that he kept getting beat up and falling asleep‚Ä¶ ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,-1
3.0,it started off slow kinda feel a sleep but the ending was good.,0
1.0,Too dark and too long!,-1
4.0,I thought it was good. Not as good as Christian Bale's batman.,1
4.0,"This was an interesting and little refreshing version of Batman. It was slightly Batman meets Sin City a bit. I came into the theatre with an open mind and also knew it was a slightly long running too. So with eyes wide open I saw a very well acted Batman/Bruce Wayne with a very interesting Catwoman. Jeffrey Wright is great in almost all he does and he also doesn't disappoint. I give it a 4 out of 5 as there could have been a little more humor in the film in my humble opinion. Overall, loved it. I was glad to not see gratuitous violence. Loved how the new batmobile was introduced! Colin Farrell is also outstanding alongside John Tuturro as the bad guys. Great move - would watch again. Great cinematography too!",1
4.0,"Some of it was maybe not child appropriate, with some curse words not for younger viewer but other than that it was a must see!",1
5.0,"Second best batman I‚Äôve ever seen. It‚Äôs not just another h√©roe movie, it‚Äôs an actual suspense, detective story. Best portrayal of the best detective. It gave me vibes from the old WB animated series.",1
5.0,Took the whole family. Love that it was unique and can stand on its own. My husband loved it the most. Will probably have to see it several more times.,1
3.0,Dark and so so long. I did not hate it but did not love it.,0
4.0,Very dark and I wouldnt recommend for young kids but it was very good! A little slow to develop and Ill need to watch it again to pick up on some things I may have missed the first time around but its definitely worth seeing.,1
4.5,Loved so much action great plot twist,1
5.0,"This was, by far, the most captivating Batman to be shared with us by Mr. Pattinson, what a cinematic masterpiece, this has made me fall deeply in love with superhero movies all over again ‚ù§Ô∏è",1
5.0,The movie was excellent. The actors were excellent. The plot was excellent. Its been a very long time since i have seen a movie that takes its time to build the characters. They missed nothing. There was enough fighting and suspense to hold the attention of the intelligent movie watcher. Its not the typical Batman.,1
5.0,"Loved the new direction they took with this Batman. As a huge fan of Christopher Nolans Batman, this rendition of the dark knight did not disappoint.",1
5.0,Great movie. action packed and thrilling.,1
1.0,I didn't get to see the movie do to a complication,-1
5.0,Great story and action,1
3.5,Robert Pattinson was ok. The movie was a bit drawn out.,0
5.0,Awesome movie Im so happy I finally saw it.,1
4.0,great movie! would have been a 5 star if it wasnt so long.,1
5.0,Me and my girlfriend had a good time it‚Äôs a good movie,1
2.0,Just wasnt as good as other movies of batman,-1
0.5,"Emo looking Batman, SLOW!!! First half I was sleepy, second half just pissed that I was wasting my time on this movie! WORST Batman EVER! (And I‚Äôve seen all since Adam West)",-1
2.0,"Not original story re: parents too many extra characters. Very, very long movie. I lost interest after awhile. Make a movie with Catwoman she was good!",-1
4.5,Very different kind of Batman movie. Robert Pattinson was excellent as both Batman and Bruce Wayne. The Riddler was so diabolical and Cat woman was Batmans love interestsort of. All in all a very good movie.,1
3.0,"Hmmm, Im not sure about this one ? The storyline is all over the place ? And back round was way too LOUD! could barely hear the characters. I kind of expected a better story line .",0
5.0,"This is how a Batman movie should be done, perfectly balanced, showcasing his detective and combat skills.",1
2.0,"Too long, could have been an hour shorter. Not the worst Batman, but not the best.",-1
0.5,"Silly use of multiple injuries. The Mayor that Shot, being completely blow off her feet, then took shrapnel while being pulled away. Then she was caught in a flood & washed downstream with tons of building pieces in the water, finally being pushed ashore and covered with steel. After all that, at the end, she is quick walking through chest deep water!! Even Batman wasnt anywhere near that resilient.",-1
4.5,It was AMAZING!!!! Watched it three times!! Some of the dialogue is a little cringy but it was almost perfect,1
5.0,I don't normally like batman movies but I actually liked this one,1
3.5,"I FORGOT MY COMMENTS. IT'S TO LATE TO DOWN GRADE MY RATING TO A 3.5-RATING. WHY: FROM MY THEOLOGICAL, MORAL & ETHICAL PROSPECTIVE 1.

I DO APPRECIATE BATMAN COMING TO HIS SENSES, THAT REVENGE IS NOT THE WAY TO LOVE, HOPE, HEALING, FORGIVENESS, PEACE & SALVATION. 3.

5.0,Loved the noir aspects of the film and that score and soundtrack overall was absolutely incredible,1
3.0,Bad acting. The riddler didnt fit. Just not a good Batman movie. At least Gordon didnt disappoint.,0
5.0,Best live action Batman Ive ever seen,1
5.0,I loved the acting and the story line,1
3.0,Not a huge fan of plot or how they story played out.,0
5.0,I hate saying 5 stars but IT WAS!! I notoriously fall asleep in theater but this was beginning to end action and excitement,1
5.0,Definitely love the Darkness!!,1
5.0,"Fantastic movie! I really liked Batman being the investigative detective, along with all of the exciting action sequences! My kids really enjoyed it!",1
4.0,This movie starts a bit slow. But is a masterpiece and truly breaks the psychological side of Batman. The Riddler is extremely calculated and menacing in this film. I love every bit of this movie. It‚Äôs a must watch and leaves you wondering what‚Äôs next.,1
0.5,"Extremng BOOORING,..1 hour of boredom in and only 8 minutes of excitement then boring til the 2 hour mark and another exciting part then more boredom. Only the last 30 minutes was kind of exciting. TOO much boring dialog, extended boring scenes that should've been cut short. Save you're money and wait til it's on a streaming service.",-1
5.0,"What does a liar do when dead? He lies still. Something that‚Äôs going to keep you drawn from beginning to end. From a dark story, wonderful performances and a brilliant pace, The Batman by far is among the best films of the year.",1
4.5,It‚Äôs a more dark and psychological Batman. A good change from overdone movies.,1
5.0,Excellent action movie. Lots of good special effects and many twists of plot lines. I would see it again. It doesn't hurt that the Batman is Rob Pattinson and therefore easy on the eyes.,1
5.0,this movie was refreshing and powerful. I loved getting to see Batman so grounded in each scene.,1
4.0,"The visual appeal of this movie is off the chart. It oozes mood. Every frame is rich with a mixture of filth and beauty. the score is one of the most enthralling that I've heard in a long time. While the story got lost in its own details a little bit, it is an engrossing detective story. Ultimately this movie is a little weird and a few beats feel off, but somehow it pulls off a thrilling experience from a series that I suspected was dead.",1
5.0,Love this version of Batman...non stop action and the storyline is phenomenal,1
5.0,Great storyline & actors were exceptional,1
3.0,The movie was a bit too long. It could have used some small bit of humor or a light spot to give some contrast in the never ending darkness.,0
0.5,The longest stupidest Batman ever made period.,-1
4.0,"Just too many dark scenes, otherwise would see BATMAN again.",1
4.0,It was ok but nothing extraordinary.,1
2.0,"I liked our seating. Did not enjoy the actual movie Supporting characters horrible acting, not enough action and fight scenes, too many long dialogues, picture quality very poor too long and too boringly dramatic at the wrong times. Special effects werent captivating at all",-1
5.0,Great movie. Well done,1
5.0,the most handsome Batman! I liked everything of this movie.,1

4.0,Movie was better then we expected. We enjoyed a theme through the movie. Good to see a movie we enjoy from start to finish,1
1.5,Very dark and too long. Odd emphasis on the various sound effects. Ear bloodening car sounds and some mumbled dialogues. It appears to rain in every scene....writer-director takes the weather/mood class a little too far. There wasn't a real wrap-up to the storyline and any teaser for future sequels unless I missed it I would just wait to stream it.,-1
4.0,Robert Pattinson did a GREAT job as Batman!! He was the only part of the movie I loved. The rest was good but he definitely stood out for me.,1
5.0,They took Batman to his roots. The detective!!! Awesome film.,1
5.0,If your a Batman fan you will love this movie it‚Äôs the darker comic version of Batman that everyone has always wanted. Robert Pattinson does a great job with his version of the character and in many ways I like this version better than even the dark night trilogy. Definitely recommend.,1
5.0,"I loved the dark, brooding, aggressive version of The Batman! The worlds greatest detective returns to the big screen in all his fight in the shadows glory, afte that Ben affleck disaster. The story was developed well and went in a believable direction. I loved it!",1
4.5,"Overall terrific movie because the book (the ""story) was really good. Very dark which I liked. The cinematography was incredible. My only compliant is that it was too violent for my taste.",1
4.0,"I didn't think vamp sparkle could pull it off but ... he did. but 3 hours??!!! It was worth the price of the movie ticket though, enjoyed it.",1
1.0,Over all very disappointed !!! Casting team did a very bad job !! Batman look like Drug addict !!! And poor choose of a actor for Alfreds role . Alfred should be play by someone have very heavy British accent !! First 60 minutes of the movie so Boring !!!!,-1
5.0,It is a must see if you are a batman fan!!!!,1
5.0,I liked the dark more realistic Batman in this movie the most .,1
2.0,"Unbalanced editing, some great set pieces, but more comedy than actual intrigue.",-1
4.0,a good movie that makes you want more. that is the issue I had because it felt unfinished. maybe that was the set up for sequels.,1
0.5,"it dragged on omg. It felt longer than Endgame (incl. end scene). There were too many drawn out scenes, that at some point I started watching YT vids DURING the movie.",-1
5.0,It‚Äôs the best acting I‚Äôve seen in a Batman movie in a long time.,1
3.0,Too dark. Not enough story. Too much violence,0
5.0,Different and loved it!,1

5.0,This movie may be the best Batman movie to date. It was absolutely great.,1
4.0,Well done. Excellent reboot..,1
5.0,Robert Pattinson was excellent. His acting was just phenomenal. The best Batman yet. Loved it. Worth the three hours,1
3.0,It was just alright! There were too many scenes that had be scratching my head!!,0
4.0,"Pretty good film , just a little long , but still entertaining üòÄüëç",1
5.0,"Great movies, I liked all the scenes with Batman in it.",1
5.0,"Pretty good movie, it‚Äôs one big mystery/puzzle",1
1.0,We caught the matinee show. All storylines and no action. My date and I fell asleep multiple times throughout the movie. Like seriously 3 hours of my life wasted. We shouldve stayed in bed. More action going on there anyway.,-1
2.0,"Ummmm it was very long with nothing happening. Batman looked good but otherwise, all the acting was just ok, storyline was boring and not very well casted.",-1
5.0,I loved the action sequences,1
5.0,"Enjoyed movie, loved last riddle",1
5.0,a throw back to the original series,1
1.5,Too long. Too much dialog. Too much foul language. I know that there is a dark side to batman but seems like most of the scenes were in the dark,-1
5.0,Best Batman movie ever,1
5.0,Its was great movie!,1
4.0,Long movie but allowed for more depth and character development.,1
4.0,Non stop action! Great new twist on Batman story,1
4.5,I loved the whole movie!! Robert Patterson is the best Batman!!,1
4.0,Different view of Bruce Wayne and the dynamic between Batman the police and the city. Darker version of the iconic character,1
3.0,The background was either shades of black or gray. It was difficult to see the characters. Lighten up the screen background. There's got to be more creative ways to show darkness or evil. Try birightness. Evil always looks cheerful int he beginning. The film quality reeked of cheapness.,0
4.0,"Too long, a little too dark.",1
5.0,"If there really was someone tough enough to be a superhero this is how it would look. Makes the whole thing somewhat more believable, for those of us who struggle through many superhero movies these days.",1
5.0,Throughly enjoyed this iteration of Batman. You can only tell the same story so many times and I thought this was very well done. Robert Pattinson was a pleasant surprise. Really like what he brought to the role.,1
4.5,Good I was just looking for more special effects,1
4.5,Robert Pattinson did superb as the Batman Loved it! All three hours!,1
4.5,Outstanding and prob by fave Batman movie to date. I've seen them all.,1
4.0,Fun movie. Good story and great music,1
5.0,This movie was amazing! The pace was perfect and such a great rendition of the Batman! I can only hope the cast can stay together long enough for 3 movies.,1
1.0,possible the WORSE batman movie in history.,-1
5.0,I didn‚Äôt like cause mine and my husband sit did not heat and we was cold the whole time,1
2.0,"The first hour was dreadfully slow, didn't make musch sense. I fact, overall the plot unfilded very very slowly, and wasn't worth waiting for. I almost walked out. but Tuturroo was delightfully menacing evil, Jeffrey Wright, Colin Farrell and Zoe Kravitz all played their parts really well, the parts just weren't that interesting. Paul Dano was believably insane. But basically it was eye candy and bits and pieces of good stuff. It was probably over an hour too lonmg.",-1
5.0,"Dark movie, very good script.",1
4.0,Totally did not have any good expectations about this film and I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected! Lots of little things in the film that made this take on the Dark Knight a truly fresh take. I heartily recommend this film.,1
5.0,Good movie but a bit long.,1
3.0,Way too long and didn't require cat woman,0
2.5,Good story line- but boring -,-1
5.0,"This is a great movie. The story was believable, with occasional over the top Batmanesque style schemes. Acting was better than expected. Would watch again at home. Worth $20 and 3 hours. üëçüèª",1
1.0,Worst Batman made. The Shallow dialogue along with undeveloped characters made it Poor quality & the Scenes were so lengthy. It was too dismal with little enticement left for imagination. Not to mention the 30 minutes of obnoxious previews. The delicious popcorn was the only thing that made it worthwhile.,-1
5.0,i liked the new batman. i liked the story line. i liked the actors portraying the characters,1
1.0,"Garbage movie. Bad acting by Patinson in the extreme, no discernible plot, scenes with zero speaking that last waaaaay to long and no chemistry between the cast, especially between Kravits and Patinson. As for the theme of Batman, this was a weak, afraid wimp in a costume who had rage fits where ue was worse than the bad guys. To summarize: garbage.",-1
5.0,"It‚Äôs a great movie it gave me a real life feel , Towards the end Batman became a Hero to the people",1
1.0,"First of all, the movie has very little lighting. You have to lean foreward to try and see anything. Its a dark movie, I get it, but Bruce Wayne seems to never wash his hair, is constantly depressed and everyone speaks in low tones. There's absolutely no happiness or joy in any scene, and the music plays the sames notes relentlessly. Is it possible to make a movie TOO dark? I think they've succeeded.",-1
4.5,Finally felt like a real Batman movie.,1
5.0,"The movie kept you intrigued with the question of who is the Riddler. It was a little slow moving but thats the theme of Batman, mysterious and dark. I love Batman so I was not disappointed. Robert Patterson did an excellent, excellent job. His my favorite now.",1
5.0,"Was a little long, but was interesting and never felt long, or boring. Good script, decent acting. Good take on the Batman story.",1
3.0,Slow and way too long,0

5.0,I really enjoyed it!,1
5.0,Super good. Loved the story plot.,1
4.0,needs more zoe kravitz.,1
4.0,Started off really slow. A really dark partial of the character. A really cool version of the batt mobile. The movie is three hours long,1
5.0,Great camera work and vision a different but thought out Batman movie,1
5.0,"I loved the action and the mystery, I believe Pattinson is a great fit for Batman cant wait to see more.",1
5.0,One of my favorite moviesss!!!,1
4.5,Great. Movie !! second time watching it.,1
5.0,"Action packed, good story with a twist or two. Already looking forward to a possible Batman 2!!",1
5.0,Great plot but too long,1
5.0,Action packed thriller!!!!,1
1.5,"Actor sucks, too much liberal politics and fake DC punishments for criminals.",-1
4.5,It was slow to begin but we liked the tie-in with the characters. It was a bit long.,1
5.0,I love the detective style of Batman,1
5.0,It‚Äôs basically Batman investigating the zodiac killer in the movie ‚Äúseven.‚Äù It‚Äôs brilliant.,1
5.0,"Great parallels and better backstory. What was great is that this Batman was realistic with the gadgets, combat and stunts.",1
2.5,Too Long to get to the point.,-1
5.0,MUST SEE ABSOLUTELY THRILLING,1

4.5,Action packed with great plot and actors...... kept my interest.,1
5.0,Great Movie Highly recommend!,1
5.0,Well paced and built on the recent BATMAN movies themes and character development. Surprisingly refreshing and cathartic. Will recommend to all of my friends.,1
5.0,"Entertaining, thoroughly enjoyed it",1
1.0,Boring. I think worst Batman I‚Äôve seen.,-1
5.0,"As a Batman fan since the 80s, this take on the series was raw, dark, and gritty. The music, sound effects, visuals, the Gotham underworld, villains, the batsuit/batmobile/batcave, all done up so amazing! Loved it and cant wait to see what comes next in this series. Definitely a Batman film for adults with a complete story and keeps you guessing ?",1
1.0,"Entirely too long for no reason. Relationship between batman and catwoman was undeveloped, unneccesary, and unbelievable. Driving scene was absurdly long. What was the purpose of this movie? What did it offer that none of the other batman movies offered? Riddles were guessed absurdly and unbelievably instantaneously. I can go on and on. If it was 2h long, I wouldn't be as offended at how awful it was but there were so many inneccesarily long scenes that brought nothing to the movie.",-1
4.0,"I had to leave because I was just to exhausted I have a newborn and I don‚Äôt get enough rest but the movie was awesome!!! 4 stars because I‚Äôm privet to the original Michael Keaton jack, Kim, and the original Alfred!! But this Alfred was the next best to fill his shoes! Great movie a must see!!!!",1
5.0,"Terrific movie. A lot of action, clues and a great plot.",1
5.0,Loved it. Really really long. But loved it. Honored more of the comic book side to an extent. But also wanna see something like the DCEU.,1
1.0,Too dark. Creepy. Inappropriate. Should be rated R.,-1
5.0,I wasnt certain if Robert Pattinson had the depth of character to be able to play this role. But I was wrong. He was awesome!,1
1.0,"The move was way too dramatic, and Batman looked too serious the whole time, not saying much in between. Some areas of the movie were okay like the penguin scenes. But everything else I think could have been done a bit different. After watching this (more action needed), I don‚Äôt see much interest in the next chapter. Not trying to downplay the franchise, but disappointed compared to the last Batman - dark knight rises",-1
5.0,Everything was great!,1
5.0,The point is I didn't give this movie a shot and it surprised me,1
5.0,it's was a very good movie.,1
3.0,Did not enjoy the story line Was a little boring Too each their own.,0
5.0,Cinematagraphy was excellent,1

3.5,"Not your typical Batman Flick, but entertaining.",0
5.0,"Acting, Directing, and Scenery was amazing 10/10 Movie!",1
3.5,"Definitely a long movie (3hrs). As a huge Batman fan, I thought the story was a bit long. The characters were ok not great.",0
3.0,Dont think he was best Batman.,0
5.0,A fantastic crime story with a zodiac killer theme. You‚Äôve never seen Batman like this. Personally think The Batman beat out The Dark Knight,1
5.0,"Really good action movie. The whole cast was great and even though it was almost 3 hours the story kept me engaged and was not bored, story moved along really well. This was our first visit to a theater since the start of the pandemic and very happy we chose The Batman for our first outing!",1
5.0,An excellent Batman film. Loved it. RP is a very convincing Bruce Wayne and Batman. Must go see!,1
5.0,The Seven of Batman movies. in some places it even acts/feels like the other Fincher film Fight Club. Solid.,1
5.0,Movie was great better then expected.,1
0.5,This is honestly THE worst Batman movie I‚Äôve EVER seen!,-1
3.0,Not as good as I though it would be. Too much talking and not enough ass kicking!,0
2.5,It was boring with action if you know what I mean,-1
4.0,Surprisingly good - enjoyed the different take on this well-known franchise!,1
5.0,movie was very good. enjoyed every minute. the action is amazing and the storyline is unlike the other Batman movies we have seen,1
2.0,"Too much ""Dark,"" not enough ""Knight."" Knew I was gonna have issue with this when Bruce is giving the ""you're not my father,"" spiel 20 minutes in. Eisenberg acts ""more like Riddler than Luthor"" in BvS, and all's well. Dano does his best Professor Pyg, calls it the Riddler, and is applauded? Inconsistent, much?",-1
4.5,Best Batman movie ever,1
5.0,"Really well done, Great selection of actors, great story. I would of went with Selena.",1
5.0,"Very good movie. Emotional, action packed, murder mystery.",1
4.0,I enjoyed this exciting movie from start to finish.,1
4.5,"Movie was good, casting was making me wonder at first, but after watching the movie the casting makes it perfect",1
5.0,"Great moviemy kid loved it as well,..",1
4.5,"Wow. I really liked this film. A dark, gritty, grounded detective Batman story. Just off my first watch, I liked pretty much everything about it. The cast, the villains, story, all of it. Robert Pattinson does a fantastic job as Bruce/Batman. Zoe Kravitz shines as well. And Paul Dano gives a terrifying performance as the riddler. Just great. I also liked Jeffrey Wright & Colin Farrell in their roles too. It was cool and fun to kind of figure out the riddles with Batman as the film goes on. That was a nice touch and a plus. The whole detective angle is something I really enjoyed. Also that chase scene was thrilling and very well done. I was on the edge of my seat. I‚Äôve never been a big Batman fan, however I think with this film they won me over. I would love to see a sequel and what do next!",1
5.0,"I‚Äôm a huge Batman fan, and this is the Best Batman movie I‚Äôve seen! I could go on and on , but this was an absolute pleasure to watch!",1
4.0,Hopeful for the next film the DC Villains will appear with there actual outfits from the comics,1
4.0,"TOO LONG, but pretty good.",1
5.0,"Probably the best rendition of Batman in my opinion. It is dark, gritty. and it shows Batman near his beginnings, growing from a feared symbol of vengeance and violent judgement, to the symbol of hope that we all know and love! If you like Batman then this is a must watch.",1
5.0,A long movie but action-packed from start to finish. I loved it.,1
5.0,"Suspense and dark tone were amazingly well done. In the theatre, sound seemed to reverb through our seats. Total suspension of disbelief -- a sign of an excellent movie. Robert Pattison was a great pick in the largely young cast.",1
3.0,"Based on reviews I expected this movie to stand out. Understandably the character of Batman has always been the brooding, dark type which Robert plays really well ( may be so well that I did not feel a connection with his character- he was depressing). The story on the other hand, drags, does not develop the character of Bruce Wayne into the wealthy philanthropist that he is known to be, it fails to develop the other characters as well, touching briefly here and there on them and focusing on Gordon/Batman for most of the time. The biggest Negative to me is that it fails to keep us on the edge of our seats- they build some suspense but dilutes it down with the slow pace instead of taking us into more and more suspense until the final reveal. The ending was also not satisfying - we expected a more conclusive one I think. Overall yes it was entertaining but I fail to see how this movie is 'the best' batman ever!",0
2.5,very hard to hear them speaking!!!,-1
4.0,The storyline was pretty good,1
1.5,Way too dark to really see and hard to follow.,-1
4.0,"Seemed easier to follow and a bit smarter, more realistic and easier to pay attention than previous Batmans. Also really good casting.",1
5.0,All the actors rocked,1
3.0,It was ok. Not enough action for me but it was just ok. it took so long to get the storyline going. It just wasn't that good.,0
0.5,I could barely hear the dialogue. It was very slow and didnt give me the Batman vibes ya know.,-1
2.5,It felt like I had seen it before. It also felt long.,-1
1.0,My kids and I all fell asleep. Horribly boring.,-1
5.0,Best Batman yet. Gotham was like a character in the movie. Highly recommend.,1
2.5,Overall it was OK. The sound was way too low and I found myself straining to hear much of the dialogue. The action was good and the story was OK but the sound almost ruined it for me.,-1
2.5,Too long a movie. It was a sphagetti of a convoluted plot.,-1
4.0,Way more detective oriented and i loved that. Great setting. Great acting. Great story.,1
5.0,Absolutely immersive and realistic. Best. Batman. Movie,1
2.5,2.5 might be generous.,-1
5.0,Best Batman movie! Lots of action!,1
5.0,It was so good! RPatz is my Batman! It was a great look into Batman becoming the hero we are used to. Also this Batman doesn‚Äôt believe in the use of guns! Woot woot!!,1
5.0,"Fantastic movie...feels like I was watching the comic book come to life. Patterson did great as a young Bruce Wayne, im excited to see his development in the upcoming movies. The rest of the cast were all great as well. We finally saw Batman as the world's greatest detective in this movie. It was a different take on the character compared to past movies. 9 out of 10.",1
5.0,Liked that it was earlier in Batmans story.,1
0.5,"I am a huge fan of superhero movies, especially DC But man, they will never be able to make a decent live action movie. The pacing was SO slow, the script was terrible, the characters had no development whatsoever, and, most of all , the plot was 1 dimensional Gotta say, I was extremely excited to see this movie and wouldve left the theater early if I hadnt paid so much to see it.",-1
1.0,"By far the worst Batman movie! There was no character development, and the story line was pitiful.",-1
4.0,"For a storyline that is already played out, this was quite a fresh take. Very enjoyable!",1
5.0,Great movie... other than the length I can't really complain about anything. Don't stick around for the post credit clip... almost worthless,1
2.0,"This movie felt like it was trying too hard to fill the shoes of the dark Arkham comics. Bland dialogue and pitch-black lighting makes this movie drag. To round it all out, the acting was only mediocre, with flashes of decent performance here and there. Unless you are a diehard Batman or DC fan, this movie is not worth watching.",-1
5.0,Truest Batman connection to the comics!,1
4.0,"It has a stylistic noir feel. The cinematography and storyline were interesting, but the movie lacked character development. Also, the pace seemed to drag and it could have likely been improved through editing and fewer dramatic visuals.",1
4.5,"One of the best Batman movies out there, we haven't seen the caped crusader since Justice League but that is an entirely different bat. If you're hungry for a new and in my opinion better Batman then I highly recommend you go see this film! Now this film isn't perfect no movie is but it will definitely satisfy that Batman craving you may have plus if you're a fan of Robert Pattinson then you will be happy with his performance in this movie. This movie is absolutely amazing so just go see it I can guarantee you will love it if not at least enjoy it, this film is a Batman film you won't want to miss!!!",1
1.0,Too dark. Not for kids. Didn‚Äôt like the new Batman.,-1
3.5,"Movie was good, WAY too long. Couldve been shortened by an hour easily. But good characters, and good ending that suggests more to come.",0
2.5,Its such a realistic movie but quite Melancholic all throughout. Kept me feeling on the edge of my seat,-1
5.0,great batman the best one i like addie from dark night,1
4.5,The service was great and The Batman is awesome though long,1
5.0,"Amazing story. More of a mystery/detective movie than a superhero movie. Best all-around Batman movie ever produced. And thats saying a lot, because there were so many good ones prior.",1
5.0,awesome movie great story and action üëçüèæüëçüèæ,1
5.0,Loved everything about it!,1
5.0,wonderful. hope they make a few more. great casting.,1
5.0,A true comic book detective Batman.,1
0.5,Didn't feel like a Batman movie. It felt like a moody mafia movie rather than a hero movie.,-1
5.0,Amazing!! Characterization perfect!!,1
3.5,It was too long & dark.,0
5.0,"Robert Pattinson made The Batman his own unique version in this adaptation. He didn't use a raspy growl when speaking which was a relief. There was no air of flamboyance, privilege or wealth. Pattinsons Batman was dark, gloomy yet exciting. Highly recommend seeing it to all.",1
2.0,Too long. Riddler was hyper-annoying,-1
4.0,W Movie fr but dark knight,1
3.0,it was just fine. slow steady and no surprises,0
5.0,"That movie SURPRISED ME. Expectations were a tad lower for it compared to Nolans films but this Batman you cant really compare to Christan Bales role because they have different approachs to the comic. This film here had a darker approach and felt so natural to Batmans character. Acting was great, all around experience was amazing.",1
3.0,To many changes from original storyline,0
5.0,This Batman fits him well!!!,1
5.0,Full of action! Good movie,1
5.0,"Finally a detective Batman movie! If your a Batman fan who likes mystery, suspense, character building. Give it a try. Truly liked the movie. Worth a watch.",1
4.0,Yeah I‚Äôm not gonna do it right away I don‚Äôt like how much it takes me a lot of money but I‚Äôm still in a bad way and I‚Äôm still not feeling well and I‚Äôm not gonna do it again but I‚Äôm still not sure how long be able I feel that I need a little bit more to get the right one but I think it‚Äôs gonna and I‚Äôm still in a bad way.,1
4.0,"I really liked this darker take on the Batman franchise, although at some points it did feel like it was dragging on.",1
5.0,This film is amazing!!,1
5.0,"The uniqueness of this Batman is the artistry.  If you watch the movie a second time, I encourage you to pay attention to the cinematography, the lighting, the framing of the scenes, the  intentionally slow pacing, and the music - all of which work together in a noir harmony not often seen in action movies today.  The directors used lenses which were intentionally warped or distorted in certain ways and they also make use of focus and un-focus which brings you into the movie.  The music sets a dour tone reminiscent of gothic Edgar Allen Poe, further reinforced by the subtle yet over the top gothic decor of Wayne Manor.  The color theme: bronze (as bright as things ever get), red, and black, permeate throughout.  Some might criticise the music for its simplicity, but music should never distract from the movie and the tempo and tone I think reinforces the dour, gothic, brooding nature of Bruce Wayne and the mystery theme and also seamlessly transitions between batman and cat woman when they are on screen together.  The performances were quite good overall as well.  Overall, an immersive world that gets better on the second viewing.",1
3.5,"The beginning of the movie showcased a strong start with some dark disturbing thriller crime detective scenes. The middle segment of the movie was necessary for the plot, but I wasn't that interested in the emotional investment in catwoman's problems, batman and alfred's relationship, or the relationship between batman and catwoman. I enjoyed little jokes with the same nightclub's door bouncers always getting beat up. I thought the colin farrell did an excellent job as the penguin, as did all the other actors with their respective roles. The batman's theme was fantastic, I enjoy listening to it over and over. I enjoyed movie overall.",0
3.0,"it was all over the place and hard to follow, not like the other Batman movies. too many villains and hard to follow the story line.",0
4.0,Great movie but extremely long ....3 hrs. i guess we got our money's worth though!,1
0.5,It is a never ending bore.,-1
5.0,"Although the movie is long, it kept you engaged. You did not feel like it was that long.",1
1.5,"First hour-and-a-half are AMAZING, then it just falls apart- a good hour of pure exposition dumps and a completely bizarre while somehow at the same time, flat finale. Batman loses BAD. Very depressing film. It only builds you up to smash you down.",-1
5.0,"Paul dano should get a Oscar nomination. Jeffrey Wright is the coolest dude in the world. Robert Pattinson is brilliant, dark, and nuanced. This is my favorite Batman movie and might be my favorite movie ever.",1
5.0,Am 4eva in love with Keanu Reeves!!,1
5.0,"It's Keanu Reeeves, bruv.",1
4.0,all John wick are nice,1
4.0,It Could be a great ending to the series but we all know they won't let it rest when money can still be squeezed out of it.,1
5.0,"It had a continuity background story, making it more relatable to the previous movies. It's worth the money to spend at a theatre.",1
4.5,lots of action and great scenes. CG during fights at the club was not realistic. looked like something grabbed them and slammed them on the ground. but regardless it is a great movie.,1
5.0,This movie was amazing!!! the fight scenes were astonishing! especially loved the part where John Wick had the fire gun and it showed the view from above while he was going room to room to make it look like an old video game!,1
5.0,"Everytime I think they can't top a scene or plot from the previous movie, it does exactly that. The action is still incredible, the characters are memorable and it ties things off well throughout.",1
5.0,"One of the best action movies, ever.",1
4.0,"Mucha acci√≥n de principio a fin, aunque ya en algunas partes de la pel√≠cula parec√≠a m√°s un videojuego que una pel√≠cula, pero en general esta palomera.",1
4.5,They up their game every time! Loved the ride right up until the very end. Would I have ended it differently? Probably. Would that be better than the creator's version? Maybe... maybe not. Fans need to form their own opinions though. Go see it!,1
2.0,they tried too hard. Took from Warriors movie and the stairs scene was exaggerated,-1
5.0,movie was very good.10/10 would recommend,1
5.0,It was a good ending to the current story line.,1
5.0,"I Love, Love, Love Keanu anything he plays in is amazing!!",1
5.0,"Love non-stop action and tough guys beating the odds, barely working up a sweat. This was all that and then some. I better see John Wick resurrected in the next movie. He more than earned it!",1
5.0,delivers on the action and concludes the story perfectly,1
3.0,not what I expected but the fighting sequences were pretty cool,0
4.0,That Wick died at the end,1
5.0,It was a action pack movie kept you on locked in to the movie. Awesome movie we love it,1

5.0,Awesomeness!!! movie. Nobody stayed after the credits for sequel.,1
4.5,I like everything in this movie except the shootings parts for me they seem like unreal.,1
1.5,Some of the action was ok but this movie didn‚Äôt do it for me. Same stunts over and over on all the kills was just numbing.,-1
4.0,only dislike is Wick dying.,1
5.0,"if you love action, you won't be disappointed",1
5.0,Loved all the action. Better than the 3rd.,1
3.5,It was good but him falling from the third floor and getting up and getting hit by ten cars and still living was to much,0
4.5,Great movie with lots of action. Maybe a little too much shooting and killing got a little boring.,1
5.0,We chuckled a few times when fighting got absurd. The stunt man struggled to keep rolling down 200 steps. I still love the John Wick series and would go see another.,1
3.0,Sometimes less is more...,0
5.0,Always loved John wick,1
3.0,"Although packed with action, some of the scenes as with the previous JW episodes, had some outlandish chase and fight clashes. Very entertaining nonetheless....",0

4.0,Very entertaining! Great fight scenes!,1
5.0,"John wick although it has its flaws, is still an amazing movie to watch. You can follow the plot and its still entertaining and believable",1
4.5,Great action movie and actors,1
4.0,Really a bit long.Keanu Reeves seemed uncomfortable saying his lines. I know theis not about vocal expression. He just seemed very tired.,1
5.0,I freaking loved this movie. It was action packed from the beginning to the end. I love me some Keanu Reeves he an outstanding actor,1
4.5,Watching all three of the movies before this was a very good way to send off the series its been an amazing ride with John wick and I would take the ride again.,1
4.0,"Not too much dialog, I could not keep count on the number of people Wick killed.",1
5.0,A bit long but it was good,1
4.5,Great movie lots of action.,1
5.0,I knew he was his Father,1
4.0,Fighting car chasing and so much more to watch,1
4.0,Plot was not as detailed as other John Wick movies. 80%of the movie was fighting,1
5.0,"Great choreography and great sound track, 100% the best movie of the franchise.",1
5.0,The unbelievable raw stunts by John Wick and the fantastic fighting of Cain is just crazy. Must see John Wick showed out. üëå,1
5.0,Plenty of action and continues a great story line from first 3 films,1
4.0,Would of gave it 5 stars but the ending was wack,1
1.0,"I like the John Wick movies. At least I did until this one. Completely fragmented, no theme, no plot. I mean, you kind of expect a minimal reliance on those things to keep your interest in the John Wick. But it just doesnt exist in this one. Ive walked out is maybe one movie before the end. Well, until last night, it was only one. Happy to leave.",-1
2.5,"Obviously you‚Äôre not going to this movie for the emotional nuance but the action scenes were inconsistently executed - some were well done but some were clumsy or even sloppy and lazy. Actors didn‚Äôt land the blows super crisp? Eh good enough, put some more pop pop noises in to cover it up‚Ä¶",-1

4.5,Action packed good movie,1
3.5,"Not as much impactful dialogue as the previous movies, but it has good fighting scenes and a satisfying ending.",0
5.0,Full of action. Exactly what I was expecting,1
4.0,"The fast action keeps your attention, but it seems almost like a video game at times. Sure, it's just a movie, but the bad guys simply can't always seem to miss and nobody would waste as much ammo as Wick does when he taps his victims. Enjoyable, but I think this series has run its course.",1
2.0,"I've seen the first 3 multiple times. This one was 45 minutes too long, the never ending fight scenes just got boring. I would have left if my daughter didn't want to stay. Gah, wait until it comes out on streaming so you can fast forward through the endless and repetitive fight scenes.",-1
5.0,"Great movie a lot of action, I think the best of the 4, so sad is the last one , the serie great",1
5.0,Nonstop action with an underlying theme of the bonds of friendship and family. Stay for the credits.,1

3.5,Good action but too long.,0
5.0,Best way to end off the chapter for an iconic movie series üëèüèª so entertaining and satisfying üôåüèª,1
5.0,That he died because I just have to accept that there will be no more John wick,1
1.0,Worst Wick movie ever,-1
4.0,"as far as sequels it was entertaining, action reminded me of character 3 a lot.",1
5.0,"Awesome movie, loved it but won't be the same without John Wick",1
4.0,"John Wick is definitely an action packed movie! The stunts were on point, but the reason I gave it 3 stars is because no one can survive falling down ALL those stairs and still be able to walk, let alone fight! That was just bananas to me :) Other than that, it was cool. I had to google to see if there's going to be a part 5, had to wait for the credits to end. I knew that there was some unfinished business there. And, spoiler alert, John Wick isn't dead. The concierge, dead, but not John Wick ')",1
5.0,Loved it!!! Fits in well with all of the previous movies.,1
5.0,"Amazing action, surprisingly heartwrenching with some scenes that were LOL funny! Best of the series!",1
5.0,"Nonstop action, John Wick 4 does not disappoint.",1
5.0,"This action-pack movie kept me well engaged. There was little talking and lots of shooring from start to finish. However, I am. not sure how I feel about the ending. I would have liked to see him go on to enjoy some parts of life.",1
5.0,The action sequences were visually stunning super shocking at times from beginning to end and the cinematography was absolutely phenomenal through the entire runtime of the movie. This John Wick sequel movie has the best camera angles when it comes to all the fight scenes‚Ä¶.they knocked it out of the park.,1
2.0,I didn't think the movie was not as good as the first 3. They could have cut down the fighting time and put more story into the mix.,-1
4.0,a modest ending to a great series,1
0.5,Basically no plot and no acting. Lots of shooting though :(.,-1
5.0,The action pack scenes,1
4.5,I love the action and story line!!,1
5.0,"This a beautiful and absolutely bonkers film. The cinematography is rich, the dialogue spare but memorable, and the action choreography remains unmatched. The film benefits from ensemble casting and even minor characters are fascinating. One of the car-fu stunts is so outrageous yet completely plausible that I laugh out loud every time I watch it. My only regret is that I only was able to see it in the theater 7 times. Bravo.",1
4.0,"Good movie, fighting scenes were overextended and many scenes where Wick obviously shouldve been shot or killed and didntbut still a great movie.",1
1.0,"I went in with high hopes as the previous Wick's were fairly decent. However, if I could give this a zero I would give it three of them. This movie was stupid and wayyyyyyyyy overrated. The fact that so many people rated this movie highly leaves me little faith in people's perspectives. It was literally an unrealistic, 3-hour fight scene. Even on discount Tuesday, it was a waste of both time and money.",-1
5.0,Loved the movie! It was action filled and exciting and no dull moments. The almost 3 hours went by quick. I'd watch it again. Must see!,1
3.0,"I guess that this was the last one !!?? Well made movie with great actors, but the killing never seems to stop.",0
5.0,It wad action packed and kept you on the edge of the cheering on John Wick,1
1.5,"I Like Action Movies. I Think ""Taken"", all versions, is the bench mark for movies, but this was just 3 hours of mindless fight scenes.",-1
1.0,Just ridiculous. A 3 hour highly improbable (impossible) gun fight. I liked the previous John Wick‚Äôs movies and I get willing suspension of disbelief especially for action movies. But there‚Äôs a limit and this movie shoots right over it. I‚Äôm willing to believe JW can fight off hundreds of people at one time and still live (how nice they only attack in ones and twos right?). But I can‚Äôt accept that someone supposedly that smart and rich would deliberately set himself up for a situation where he would HAVE to fight hundreds of people over several hours for no reason at all. Silly silly plotting.,-1
2.0,Horrible. Same stuff over and over. Nothing new. Truly hope this is the last one,-1
5.0,Not disappointed and you won‚Äôt be,1

5.0,Action packed!!! This movie was funny and it told a story. I just loved this movie. One for the books!! Awesome,1
4.0,Plot much simpler than JW3 and probably has even more action than the previous JWs which doesn‚Äôt seem possible. All in all not a deep movie but I enjoyed it.,1

5.0,A spectacular end to a great series. 169 minutes of action somehow doesn't feel bloated or tiring or slow.,1
5.0,Action from beginning to end,1
5.0,"Little slow to start but does it get rolling! Donnie Yen is an excellent villain/friend. The action scenes are INTENSE, especially the scene around the Arc de Triomphe, bravo! The ending is ambiguous enough to leave the door unlocked in case there should be another sequel.",1

5.0,Good movie. Action packed. There was some sad parts but it was overall 9/10 movie.,1
5.0,Best Action Movie of the year.,1
5.0,"I enjoyed how the John Wick 4 story flowed & ended. As expected, the action in the movie was enjoyable throughout the movie. Reeves is a natural for this role & is the only current actor that could handle this series. I know it is still undecided if a John Wick 5 will be made. I'm torn since this was a good way to end the series without messing it up with a terrible sequel. Who knows, maybe a Wick 5 can top this one but I seriously doubt it right now. Reeves is 58 yrs old. As the usual pattern has been to wait a few years, if Lionsgate & the producers/writers decide to do Wick 5, Reeves will be over 60 & not be moving like the ""killing machine' in Wick 1, 2, 3, & 4. The other main actors may also not be available if/when they decide to do Wick 5. If they do decide to do Wick 5, it should be sooner than later.",1
5.0,This movie was crazy action packed I really enjoyed it! Glad I took the time out to come enjoy myself I usually sleep through movies!,1

5.0,"Sharpen your pencils, because this movie is anything but pointless",1
4.0,"I literally felt John's fatigue at the end of the film. I like how the film enforced his expertise with a pistol, reminds me of the first movie. The humor in the movie was just right, not over the top.",1

4.0,"While I am a fan of the franchise I wasn't a big enough fan that nearly 3 hours seemed excess, but there wasn't any dragging and the movie was fast paced and fit perfectly. Great acting, great storyline, and just a well done action packed movie. Definitely worth seeing!",1

2.0,I wish I would have stopped at 3. This movie had the highest attrition rate Ive ever seen at a theatre. Only half the people who started it stayed until the end. They could have done so much more with the plot and the acting was terrible.,-1
4.0,"This new John Wick film was very dope & visually like being on a roller-coaster ride. With creeping to the top before the drop being the tone & catalyst for 85% of the film. I will note though it was extremely long &, that kind of took me out the zone of it's overall greatness almost. I'd still see it again though!",1
5.0,"Loved the movie, John wick is a classic series that I will watch every single year without question. Keanu Reeves works so hard for these movies and it shows deserves nothing less than five stars!",1

5.0,absolutely loved John wick 4 and hope there is another,1
4.5,Great movie my husband and I both enjoyed it,1
5.0,I like everything the best John Wick movie so far,1
4.5,"I recently watched John Wick 4, and overall it was a fantastic action movie that kept me on the edge of my seat. The plot follows John Wick (Keanu Reeves) as he tries to defeat the powerful High Table and earn his freedom. However, he must face off against a new enemy with powerful alliances across the globe and old friends turned foes. The action sequences in this film were nothing short of amazing, as they were well-choreographed and executed to perfection. Keanu Reeves delivered an exceptional performance, and the rest of the cast also did an excellent job. However, there were a few issues that I noticed with the movie. Firstly, Bill Skarsgard's character felt out of place in the film, and his accent was somewhat off-putting. Additionally, some of the slower scenes dragged on a bit, which made the pacing feel a little uneven at times. Despite these minor issues, John Wick 4 is still an enjoyable and worthwhile movie to watch. The plot was intricate and kept me engaged throughout the film. The character development was also noteworthy, as Wick faced complex moral dilemmas that kept the audience invested in his journey. Overall, John Wick 4 is a great addition to the franchise, and I would recommend it to fans of the previous films and to anyone looking for a thrilling action movie.",1
4.0,Movie was good...just not as good as the others...Thanks,1
5.0,The movie was good overall I am a John Wick fan so I might be biased the ending was good wasnt sure if thats the way it was going to go was not disappointed though,1

5.0,"Excellent just all the others, John Wick movies.",1
5.0,"Great movie, amazing special effects, fights and Keanu reeves is spectacular",1
2.5,"Shooting scenes were repetitious, too long and unrealistic toward a point of becoming bored. Consequently, the length of the movie ?2hrs. 49min.? is unwarranted.",-1
5.0,"Loved this movie! Nonstop action and one of the best action movies that Ive seen in a long time. Other than the first John Wick, I thought this one was the best in the series.",1
2.0,"It's mind numbing, I'll give it that. Minimal dialogue and little to no story/plot line.",-1
4.0,"This film is a thrill ride from beginning to end with a few surprises interjected, especially at the end of the film. Some of the beginning parts are a bit disconnected and difficult to follow though, and maybe a review of previous films in the series would help with that. The characters display expected traits and yes, the good guys always seem to win. Even the dog character brings out John Wick's affection for dogs, sometimes in a humorous way. Although parts are very surreal, I think the producers want the audience to see the brutality as some sort of ballet, especially in the dancing scene late in the movie. All-in-all, I think it's a good movie, perhaps the best in the series, but you have to like this kind of movie to really enjoy it.",1
5.0,Keanu reeves . That is all,1
5.0,"spacious seating, great movie",1
5.0,Loved every minute of the movie. Action packed and as always a great story.,1

3.0,"Ton of action, but much of it ridiculous",0
5.0,"Best ride of all 4, and has inspired me to go back and watch the first three over again to resolve some of the dialogue from the 4th. This is action with a purpose. Now John needs to go after the High Table, the top of the pyramid, and do away with it altogether. Let it be full retaliation retribution for the blight on humanity they created.",1
5.0,"The plot line worked well with all the previous John Wick movies, and the ending was superb!",1

5.0,Action packed fun with a common feel!,1
4.5,Great movie. Just thought the movie could be a bit too loud at times. Not sure whether to blame the theater or the movie for that. Youll love it if you like action and fighting and dont care too much about the story,1
4.5,Action filled movie -some humor but good violence,1
2.0,Pretty bad. The first one was great. 2nd was good. 3 was better than 2. 4 was a waste of time & money. I dont like to waste either of those!,-1

5.0,"OMG I thought the last Mission Impossible was the best action movie I've ever seen. But John Wick IV is unbelievably great - visually, plot, cinematography, color tones, appropriate humor (!), ACTION, use of historic sits (Paris, Berlin, Churches, underground locations, waterways - even Renaissance paintings and the Louvre's grand gallery focused on the 18th century (Delecroix, Gericault) - mazing acting all around.

2.0,It turned into a comedy.,-1
4.0,"Was a good movie, but unrealistic. The abuse his body takes when he is trying to get to the church by dawn should have killed him. And the idea that he made it up the stairs at the end in two or three minutes is nonsense. I love the John Wick movies, own the previous three. But this one was not as good. Also thought the ending was not what should have happened after all he went through.",1
5.0,Pulled in from beginning to end,1
4.0,Great action scenes like usual but dragged out the storyline,1

4.0,"The movie was great all the way through until ACT 3. Some of the tension that is created by John having to be at a place by a certain time, felt thrown in and kind of took me out of the realism. Getting hit by cars like 5 times is not something I'm prepared to accept as not having any effect on someone.",1
5.0,If you liked the others you will like this,1
5.0,Phenomenal per usual,1
3.0,"The Dialogue, way to much action.",0
3.0,They went overboard on the fighting scenes and falling down the stairs over and over.,0
5.0,The movie was awesome! John Wick never disappoints nonstop action. my family and I can't wait for the next one.,1
1.0,"Plotless mess, gratuitous violence, pathetic dialogue, ridiculous characters I could go on, but what would be the point? This piece of commodified junk will make millions and that is the only rationale that counts in a dumbed down America.",-1
5.0,"fighting dynamics are taken to a different level while physics laws stay checked, some of the physical laws were not. it's so well done to keep audience glued to the anticipation level just very close to pre-peak throughout the entire length of the movie. and even at the end viewer minds would keep guessing the final outcome of if JW lives or this actually is the final chapter of the sequential series. well written, directed and okay acted. it is a top class in it's category of fic/action and each fight scene is worth watching multiple times for those who really are into martial arts and self defense. I am sorry to say Donnie Yens fight was a bit too unreal while being a real life mart. artist while Keanu's jiujitsu based scenes made more sense and realist. In my humble opinion, Japanese MA made lot more sense, BUT overall it's a fiction.",1
3.0,Moving was long boring scenesx,0
4.0,"Could have had a better ending, it was expected out come. So many new characters",1
5.0,Non-stop of what you know John Wick brings to the screen.,1

3.0,it's too long and repetitive I would just wait for it to come on one of the streaming services,0
5.0,"It delivered on all points as you would expect... little dialog, lots of Keanu struggling face shots. Excellent fight scenes, comeuppance, WINSTON. Sad the loss of Lance Reddick recently. Killer soundtrack, cartoonish bad guys, club dancing. All the greats!",1
3.5,Took my husband for his birthday and I have to say it was action-packed and I enjoyed it. The only drawback is that there was so much killing that it got to be too much.,0
5.0,As always Keanu did not disappoint!!!,1
4.5,New weapons for John . And I nice top look at a fight.,1
4.5,"Visually stunning with some amazing set locations and breakthrough visual affects. Each of the characters is unique and dark. This is a heavy, dark antihero film. That is not for everyone, but visually it was definitely worth seeing in the theater.",1
1.5,Too long for the story line,-1
5.0,Non stop action from start to finish. John Wick 4 will not disappoint. Keanu is incredible as well as the rest of the cast.,1

5.0,Best movie Ive seen in a long time. Saw it twice Has everything. Perfection!!!,1
5.0,the best one out of the 3 and action flowed so well. definitely a must see,1
5.0,Ill say this movie clearly had a lot of effort put into it. I was wondering why Keanu was so lazy in the Matrix and it was because he was preparing to fall down 223 steps in John Wick 4. Overall great send off to an epic performance.,1
3.0,Have a lot of action and give a good close to the first character,0
5.0,Great movie! Liked that it had more of a plot than just JW killing people the entire movie! The sound was so loud in the theatre wasn't sure if that was the theater's doing or the noise from the movie itself. My ears were humming when we left.,1
5.0,Movie was absolutely amazing.,1
3.0,Just too much!! So much of one scene could have just been taken out completely!! Not my fave one!,0

4.5,"The fight scenes are unbelievable, as if John is super human, but that's why I love all John Wick movies...the action does not disappoint.",1

5.0,Excellent movie - excellent series & excellent ending!,1
5.0,"Donnie Yen was fantastic, so much action, all around fun time!!",1
5.0,"Great ending to a series. What is there not to like. A lot of action, Wick getting his revenge and ending he deserved. Acting was superb, and there were plenty of ""wow"" moment. There is one moment I couldn't stop laughing, and I like to call it the ""stairs"", because while some scenes were ridiculous, this one was just funny too see how over dramatic the falling was.",1
4.0,story stayed the same good the fighting got old after a while,1
5.0,"The ""stairs"" scene was ridiculously funny, and the bad guy was sufficiently bad, and dogs usually win, and how many cars can you possibly get hit by. But I most enjoyed the overhead shot looking through a ""glass ceiling"" of sorts when JW had possession of the gun with the incendiary ammo.",1
5.0,"Action packed, emotional, love that Keanu",1
1.0,There was basically no storyline it was just one long ass boring fight,-1
5.0,that movie was completely magnificent. Never mess with Mr.Wick,1

2.0,Way too much violence!,-1
4.0,Pretty well shoot! action packed üíØüôèüèΩas usual üòé,1
3.0,"Pros: I really liked the twist at the end. Great solution to a problem. There were incredible action sequences. Cons: The main issues I had with the movie were the redundancy in the fighting, and the lack of respect for the laws of physics. Sequences showing Wick fending off armies of attackers dispatching them with endless rounds of ammunition got to be so many that it went from awesome to monotonous How many humans can fall from a three story building and walk away How about being hit by 3 or 4 cars and still get up and run right back into battle? This movies saving grace is the clever ending. It just took way too long to get there.",0
5.0,Excellent movie. Love Keanu Reeves,1
4.0,Enjoyed the movie. Great storyline and the villain was amazing. I really disliked him from the moment he appeared on screen. A little loud for me in the theatre tho.,1
5.0,I hope there is more to the great ending than what was shown.,1
3.5,"Good, but the first is still the best",0
5.0,Lots of action and lots of twists!,1
4.5,Thoroughly impressed to see the growth from film 1 to film 4. The storyline is fantastic and the action scenes are so amazingly ambitious but well thought out. It‚Äôs three hours for sure but we‚Äôll worth the ride. See it in theaters!,1
5.0,it delivers yet again and is as good as the others. I look forward to John Wick 5: The Devil Must Die.,1
4.0,"Ok JW4 is . Wow! Brutal death scenes and hardcore stunts in this one. Def worth our time seeing it in the theater and probably the best of all 4 movies. Howd they make this one the best? Well, they added Ip Man, of course.",1
4.5,Action packed. John Wick movies never disappoint,1
5.0,"Good movie, lots of action, some dialogue. A great film to see. Five out of five.",1

4.0,"Great action, love the story line.",1
5.0,"Lots of action very good choreography and the stunts were second to none. If you have not seen all the other John Wick movies I suggest you do before you see this Masterpiece.

5.0,"Great Movie!!!! Action packed and a martial arts lovers dream with the cast of ALL TIME BEST MARTIAL ARTISTS!!!!!! Scott Adkins, Marko Zaror and Donnie Yen just to name a few!!!!!",1

5.0,It was action packed movie loved it!,1
3.0,Keanu was great as always. Good story. Could have done a little more character building and a little less action. Did not like the way everyone had to be killed multiple times. Zombieish. A little to long. I liked the ending. It was time. RIP John Wick.,0

4.5,Really cool action scenes and some comedy,1
4.0,The action in cinematography are awesome storyline getting a little tired and my God even one of the superheroes in marvel would not be able to withstand the abuse he does and keep on going but it's John wick he gets up just himself off and keeps on going I know it's not supposed to be believable but wow,1
5.0,"Great story, great characters and lots of action in true John Wick style.",1
5.0,Awesome ending to a great film franchise.,1
1.0,Absolutely too violent and shiity,-1
4.5,"Loved it. Great culmination to the series. Everything you'd want in a John Wick flick but they added sarcastic/dry humor to the fold to really take it up a notch without it being forced. 1/2 star off because some things were telegraphed but overall a great, great movie (if you're into this type of movie). Make sure you stay until the very end of the credits!!!",1
5.0,Sorry they killed off John Wick and the hotel counter man.,1

5.0,the whole thing is 11/10,1
5.0,Fast pace action to end a 4 movie plot line. Didn't even realize I'd been there for 3 hours. Enjoyed it for what it was... straight action and gun play.,1
5.0,"This movie has alot of action, never boring.",1
2.5,It was way too long and the fighting was duplicated! Need more of a plot!,-1
4.0,"It was action packed from the start as all John Wick movies, it leaves us wonderif the John Wick saga will continue or not!",1
5.0,Excellent long movie with action from the beginning to the end ! A must see !,1
5.0,"Have you seen the other John Wick movies? If so not much else to say really, except that it's just as amazing. Honestly, with movies that have different parts, I usually end up having a liking for just 1, usually the first movie in the series but these are just a delightful experience. Go watch it!",1
4.5,"This movie is full of action, as expected, and the actor does a very good job, but, as each chapter tries to out-do all of the previous ones, this one is at times totally un-believable and too far over-the-top. Still worth seeing if your main goal is lots of action and excitement.",1
5.0,The dog stole the show! Loved the twist at the end!,1
5.0,"They basically took all the action, fights, gun play, violence etc and dialed it up to 11. Good story too. Best of the franchise IMO.",1
3.5,"Seemed to be more like a video game rather than a movie. Lots of bang bang shoot them up dialog. While 30 and 40 somethings may like it the older you get the less likely you enjoy this type of movie. For those of us who like Martial Arts it is entertaining. The hero to me is the Dog at the very end of the movie, 4 has its comical moments but is not a comedy..",0
5.0,This was so entertaining! I was on the edge of my seat and it was visually stunning!,1

5.0,Great film in the Newly Renovated Regal the sound is amazing ‚ô•Ô∏è,1
5.0,Great action sequences,1
5.0,"Longer than the rest of each series. Continuous action pact and turn off events throughout the movie. Surprise ending, and post credit clip. Is there going to be a john wick 5? Is the question your left with, opinions will vary!",1
5.0,Rude people! I think Ill skip the theater from now on. We could not enjoy the movie with people on both sides of us talking the whole time. One lady even took a phone call and carried on a conversation.,1
4.0,"If you know John Wick, you know how bloody his movies are. This one was no exception. Lots of killing and blood.",1
5.0,"So much action! Fight scenes, hand to hand combat, everything looks realistic which makes it that much better! You can tell the actors worked hard to be properly trained and it paid off! This holds true throughout this series, just great movies overall!!",1
5.0,One of the best movies I've seen this year,1
5.0,Absolutely Amazing!!,1
5.0,I wanna learn nunchucks now,1
2.5,"Perhaps my taste in movies has changed but this was about an hour longer than it needs to be. After the first 3,000 deaths the second 3,000 was kind of repetitious.",-1
4.0,"Great fight scene, good ending",1
5.0,That movie was one of the most badazz things I‚Äôve watched in years. The fighting sequences were novel and outstanding. Plot was great and overall it was a really fun watch,1

5.0,IT was none stop fun the whole time the movie ran.,1
5.0,"it was the funniest John Wick movie in the series. some of the fight sequences were toooo long, yet I would say that made it more realistic. nothing was easy for him, he had to fight his way through everything. and even though the ending was not what I wanted, it was done well and was worth the ticket price.",1
4.0,Best of the series. Long but never boring. Entertaining and full of action. A must see for John Wick fans.,1
5.0,"Thank you for the final John Wick movie. Touching scene in the end. Reunited with his love. Glad to catch John Wick on big screen before it left theatres. Great performance from all characters involved. Laurence Fishburne III, superb role your performance excellent in character as Bowery King, Ian McShane as Winston loved how his character git his New York Continental rebuild in the deal. Was surprised in seeing Charon, (Lance Reddick's role ending the way it did, very surprised. Donnie Yen as Caine was a bad bounty hunter loved seeing Him perform his role as a blind man who still took out his targets as I enjoyed, seeing camaraderie with John Wick in the ending. Loved this movie. I could go on but will close with my review with an exhilaration feeling of excitement. Worthy to see if there are John Wick followers who haven't seen it yet. ‚ú®",1
5.0,Best of all of them!,1
5.0,Definitely worth the money. the action is still there. The brilliantly told story is still there. Not too many movie franchises can hold it together for more than two installments. I am very happy to say number four what is amazing.,1
3.0,"Very average movie, way to long for the plot and lighting was very similar to a horror movie, shot at night. Plot was convoluted and fight scene were just way to unrealistic. I am a huge Wick fan, but this was just to far fetched l",0
5.0,Easily the best cinematic movie of the 4 chapters. Story and action sequences are so rich with environment and the music blends it all together. favorite song is during Killa scenes. Blood Code by Le Castle Vania was such an epic choice! Scott Adkins brought his A game! saw this movie twice and can't wait to own it!,1
5.0,Lots of action. Movie was superb,1

5.0,It was long but worth every bit of it.,1

5.0,Loved all the action. Love the franchise.,1
5.0,It showed he died at the end but I don't think he did! Number 5 come on!,1
3.0,Worst one of the 4! A 2:40 movie and could have done all that shooting in an hour.,0

5.0,It was nice but I guess its over. Lol,1
5.0,"I admit I was slow to warm to the John Wick series, but this one is the best one yet. The martial arts choreography is just so stunning and the filming so lush and clever, and the exotic locations are so beautiful that you hardly feel any guilt about the glorified violence and unbelievable body counts. Parents should heed the R rating.",1

5.0,The non-stop action was amazing!!!,1
5.0,Great and awesome action movie. Sorry to see John go. He went out with a bang.,1
5.0,It really tied up the loose ends it was supposed to. The story was great. The callbacks to previous John Wick movies were pretty cool. The action is of course stellar!,1
3.5,"Good movie, got to be a little much after the first hour. How many times can this character get hit by speeding cars, shot at, fall down hundreds of stairs, fall out windows, just to get up and shrug it off. Good ending though!",0
2.0,"Like all other previous Wicks...action filled. That having been said it was excessively long due to the lengthy, unbelievable (in a bad way) fight sequences. Enjoyed most of the others and believe that John Wick dying was appropriate!!!!! No more sequels please!!!!!",-1

5.0,We need the video game version of the John Wick series‚Ä¶.just saying!!!!!,1
5.0,The actions part was awesome will tell people to watch,1
5.0,It was a great movie. Non stop action for sure,1
5.0,Of course I liked all the action. Thats what all the Wick movies are all about. I didnt realize it was the end of the series. Am anxious to see what Keenu Reeves does next! A fan forever!!!!,1
4.5,"Loved it, great movie fun!",1
5.0,I am a John Wick fan and have seen all of the series. This last and final one is by far the best!! Imagine that!,1
5.0,I'm a John Wick from the first movie. Excellent fight scenes and a bunch of them!,1
4.0,"It was very satisfying action wise. Story line was solid. Point removed for the ending, although some folks are bound to be happy with it.",1
3.0,The plot of the story did not continue from John Wick chapter 3 but the action was worth watching and of course Donnie Yen.,0
4.0,"The storyline was less strong than the earlier episodes. Body count was higher, I think.",1
5.0,Great addition to the series.,1
5.0,Well Keanu Reeves never seems to disappoint!,1
4.5,I loved the movie I'm a huge fan of Keanu Reeves it had a lot of action hope there's more John Wick,1
4.0,Loved the whole movie. Lots of action. Keeps you interested all the way. But some of the scenes did look fake. That's the only thing I have to say negative. But it wasn't really obvious. Gonna have to go back and watch the other 3 again.,1
3.5,"It was nonstop action, and a good story, except for John Wick dying in the end.",0
5.0,This was an awesome add on to the existing John Wick content. There were multiple ups and downs throughout the movie. Stick around for the end credit scene.,1
5.0,"Kung fu action and humor was there like all the other John Wick movies, but the camera angles, lighting, and shadows really was artfully done.",1
5.0,Movie was great. Movie theater not so much.,1
5.0,"We absolutely loved the show!! We watch 1,2,3 at home on tv all the time. Very sad to see that he died, or is he?? Can't wait to see what the future holds for John.",1
5.0,Full of action. I also appreciated the tribute to The Warriors.,1
5.0,"Some stunts were a little far out there, but John Wick is all about stunts and fights. Love the movie",1
3.5,"I understand it is based on a comic and it is fantasy with hero tendencies. The story was short sighted, the villain had very little presence, His friends were not very substantial. The fights were overboard repetitive, and the number of times Wick was hit by a car and thrown down the stairs was wearisome. The story has run its course, but was entertaining.",0
5.0,"great movie, filled with nonstop action",1
2.0,It was a very long movie. Too many unbelievable unnecessary shooting. I shouldve stayed home.,-1
5.0,"The movie was amazing. The music score was great especially for how the movie flowed. The part at the steps, was definitely my favorite combat scene.",1
5.0,Like all the action and suspense.,1
5.0,Great action - wont disappoint,1
5.0,Fun and exciting from start to end!!,1
4.0,It was good movie overall some of the movie was sketchy a little but good movie tho,1
5.0,I loved this action packed John Wick 4.,1
5.0,All of it but was sad about the ending,1
4.5,Loved all your of it! John Wick action with a touch of humor,1
5.0,The whole movie is absolutely fantastic and great ending,1
2.0,"Huge fan of John Wick, however I was not impressed at all with this chapter. Zero plot with nothing but non-stop shooting and rediculous fighting. would not recommend this movie to anyone.",-1
4.5,"Great action, and great way to end it!",1
3.5,The movie is almoat non stop action. And i think the end is thrilling,0
5.0,"SPOILER ALERT: This part was great, as all other John Wick movies! Fights were brutal, especially the ones with the nunchucks and the ones at the staircase in the end. There was just a little part in the movie where I got a little bored, and that was the part where John was preparing for his final round, but that was only for about 10-15 minutes, and it was more because movie lasts a little longer. The only thing that made me sad is his sudden death in the end.",1
5.0,Over the top action. Everything I expected from a John Wick film,1
5.0,The movie had a lot of action. Great movie!,1
4.0,Kept my attention the entire time. Action packed. Great scenery,1

4.0,Good pace and lots of action.,1
5.0,"Awesome movie and as always, very action-packed! Can't wait until the final chapter!!",1
4.5,The movie had a lot of action scenes. I loved how past relationships with John Wick made one wonder how any particular scene might play out.,1
4.0,"It was pretty good. I did ""boooo"" at some overdone fight scenes. Any time I fuss at the screen I enjoy myself.",1
5.0,It was ended very well. Few movie franchises start out without plans of sequels turning out as good as all these 4 movies did,1
4.0,Left with questions but very entertaining. Im going to miss Jonathan.,1
5.0,Perfect ending for the Wick series.,1
5.0,Great action all the way through the movie,1
4.0,Great action story was lacking,1
5.0,I sometimes feel a tinge of guilt for how much I revel in the John Wick movies but as a lover of grand cinema hardly anything is grander. Violence made beautiful. And none of the series more glorious and gorgeous than this installment. If there any stops left to be pulled they‚Äôre out now. Absolute poetry in motion. The only reason you even notice that there is precious little dialogue is because Stahleski leans into it with his protagonist and turns it into an enhancement. What John does say are nuggets of gold. Keanu Reeves was born to be John Wick. I have only one tiny complaint but if I tell you what it is I‚Äôll be dangerously close to a plot spoiler. So I‚Äôll just say I‚Äôm hoping it means we‚Äôre not done here.,1
4.5,very good edition to the John Wick franchise.not quite as good as JW3 but still very good.great twist with dog.9 out of 10,1
5.0,"Action packed, stay until the credits are finished for an unexpected surprise.",1

5.0,Action packed! Really enjoyed it!!!,1
5.0,"Good plot line and left you guessing, at the end.",1
5.0,A lot of good action,1
5.0,As always John took care of business. The shepherd urinating on the guy was funny. I was sad that John Wick passed away.,1
5.0,Love the All the Chapters can't wait for five gonna be hard to top this one.,1
5.0,Action sequences had me smiling from ear to ear the entire movie. Keanu never fails to deliver with his actions (not stunts lol) and Donnie Yen was beautiful to watch as always,1
4.0,A true tribute to the Warriors cult followers,1
5.0,"Definitely worth the wait, time, and money. I'd see it again!",1
5.0,"Great installment! action packed, with some new and creative visual effects. I love the way they continue to expand upon the John Wick mythology.",1
5.0,"Loved the ending shootout, had no idea that was coming.",1
5.0,"It started off a little slow, but ended with a bang.",1
5.0,Great addition to an awesome franchise! KEANU AND CAST WERE AMAZING!,1
5.0,Have watched the first three of the John Wick movies and this one was the best!,1
5.0,Sad to see the series end but it was done in style,1
4.0,Story line good A lot of unbelievable shooting,1
5.0,Did not disappoint was perfect it,1
4.5,"Nonstop action, literally absolutely nonstop the whole way. Again, the JW franchise takes you to sites all over the world and verifies once again the consequences of hurting a dog. This movie is so much fun and you‚Äôll keep thinking to yourself how do the JW creators keep finding the most unique & satisfying ways to kill a man?!?! The John Wick 4 is the best out of the bunch and proves that some sequels just keep getting better and better!",1
5.0,"Movie was the perfect blend between action and humor. Writers did a great job ending the franchise. We saw a tired but relentless human being, trying to earn his freedom. Soundtrack, locations, cast, dialogs all on point! I‚Äôm definitely adding it to the collection to watch it marathon estile at leas once a year. Totally recommend!",1
5.0,Mucha accin desde el principio de la pelcula definitivamente la recomiendo,1
3.0,"The reason I loved the John Wick movies were because he was just a normal guy trying to live his life, but if you crossed him, you paid the price. John Wick 4 is just literally constant, non stop fighting. It was a 3 hour blend of The Matrix and Mortal Combat.",0
5.0,as exciting as the first 3. well done.,1
5.0,Nothing to dislike. Keanu is a God.,1
4.0,this was a fun ride from start to finish. production value was great felt like a comic book exploded in my face overall good comedy moments and the action was great tons of gore. go watch this.,1
5.0,"Death and destruction become a beautiful thing to watch in this movie. Action storytelling that seamlessly breathes in comedy and drama, with some of the most interesting and definitely most colorful characters in a superhero film.",1
5.0,I actually enjoyed the movie. It was one of the greatest movies Ive seen since James Gunn is a good movie director.,1
4.5,Finally DC stepping up to right direction. This IS the Suicide Squad.,1
4.0,"I liked this movie a lot. Tons of fun and the character interactions were great. HBO did a disservice to this movie, placing it on HBOMax. Bring back Boomy!!!",1
5.0,what a masterpiece üôå,1
5.0,"Fantastic cast that are properly developed unlike the previous iteration of this franchise. incredibly funny and violent with the James Gunn charm people have grown to love from the Guardians of the Galaxy movies. it's ridiculous, bloody, funny, heartwarming and an all around good time. Hopefully DC can ride the momentum of taking the obscure characters in their comics and making them likeable since it seems to be working.",1
1.0,What a train wreck!! Go see anything else.,-1
5.0,we all know this is the best movie ever. James Gunn to the rescue of wb.,1
1.0,It wasn‚Äôt as good as I anticipated. The only good character was Harley Quinn.,-1
3.5,"I love Idris Elba. The end!!! Seriously, I enjoyed the movie. The dialogue was and some scenes were humorous! It was too gory for my taste. But Idris Elba was in it. The subtitles didn't fit onto the bottom of the screen. So if you were unfamiliar with the Spanish language, you'd be out of luck in some of the scenes.",0
2.5,This movie was too far out there for my taste,-1
5.0,funny and wonderful graphic,1
4.0,It was like watching a comic Wildy entertaining I kept laughing & lots of action,1
1.0,a starfish.... really? not good,-1
3.0,It was really gross. Full of gore and body horror. The action and plot were nice but filled with obvious tropes.,0
5.0,Fun non stop action. Great story telling. NOT anything like the first. Saw it twice. A bit of bloody gore so sensitive parents beware--have your children cover your eyes.,1
5.0,I did like the movie it was fun I wish there was a bit more humor in it the characters were great but it was kind of confusing about which characters were together as a team !,1
2.0,Movie was too bloody and the plot was a re-tread of the Dirty Dozen.,-1
3.0,"Beginning really sucks. If youve seen it, you know why. Story is very disjointed, action scenes are ok. Cenas tighty whitey scene s worthwhile. As are a few other similar scenes. Other than that. Is was just ok. Dont waste your money in a theater. Wait til it comes out on Netflix.",0
2.0,Kinda dumb premise but had a happy ending.,-1
4.0,Didn't like what happened to the weasel. Didn't like that Flag died. Didn't like how Peace Maker switched up on his squad.,1
5.0,"Funny, very entertaining",1
4.0,Way better than the 2016 suicide squad garbage.,1
5.0,Unique and imaginative story line with awesome characters!,1
4.5,WTF rats Awesome !!!,1
4.0,"It was what you‚Äôd expect, not a cinematic masterpiece but funny and witty sometimes with some sad parts and the ending was cool",1
4.0,"I will gladly go see any James Gunn movie - he is a master storyteller, and he always comes through.",1
4.0,Very fun to watch and killer shark was great.,1
1.0,"It was too slow, boring and just ridiculous. What a waste of money.",-1
5.0,The whole experience,1
2.0,Basically sucked. Definitely no where near as good as the original. Storyline was fractured as f*ck!!,-1
2.0,Not what I expected!,-1
3.0,More silly than serious.,0
1.0,The whole thing. Stupid from beginning to end.,-1
5.0,"I really liked the second movie a lot better, it was funnier.",1
5.0,Margo Robbie kicks ass!!!,1
1.5,Not a very good story line. The starfish was kind of lame.,-1
2.0,"It's a kids movie but has too much gore and sexual language for kids to see, and far too silly for adults. Boring in spots almost fell asleep many times. Nothing like Harley Quinn movie, so don't expect that level of action.",-1
2.0,"not understanding the point of bringing in so many characters to kill majority off in the first 5 minutes then other vital characters by the end of the movie. I get it's the suicide squad and they die, but bringing characters to life as plot devices to kill is just unfortunate.",-1
5.0,Definitely kept my attention throughout the movie. Good choice to watch.,1
4.5,"Decent movie, definitely not something to take kids to though",1
5.0,so amazing. Nanaue and Ratcatcher2 were the best but the rivalry with Bloodsport and Peacemaker was something else,1
4.0,It was definitely an improvement over the 2016 film and got a lot of things right.,1
5.0,Just the right mix of insanity and storytelling.,1
4.0,"The show was awesome. I found the storyline a little confusing. The action was great. I dislike that Will Smith was not in this one, but I loved Idris Elba's role in the movie!",1
2.5,"movie skipped around a bit, very little character development",-1
4.0,Lots of f bombs good movie overall,1
1.0,"very crappy, all over the place and not worth watching.",-1
3.5,no plot to strory lots of action with out meaning tho,0
3.0,I really liked the first half of the movie but the last act got really long and kind of silly.,0
5.0,"I was a fun romp, though I wish there was more Harley Quinn.",1
5.0,It was fun. My expectations were met.,1
5.0,Very good a lot better than the first one and Margot Robbie is hot,1
1.0,need more psyidelics to enjoy,-1
5.0,There was a lot of good humor and well done acting. It was a fun movie to watch.,1
5.0,"Great movie. 100% a James Gunn production, and definitely top 1 or 2 best current DC universe films.",1
5.0,Finally the squad is here!! MUCH better story. MUCH better cast. MUCH better directing.,1
5.0,well worth the ticket almost had a quin terin tino feel to it,1
1.0,Awful! The movie was just awful! Waiting for a good part. There were NONE!! The bad guy was a pink and blue star fish. Skip this movie. I wouldnt even spend the money to rent it!!,-1
5.0,100% better than the first movie if dc was smart they have Gunn do more movies maybe set in world war 2 like haunted tank and Sgt rock add unknown solider the loser etc,1
0.5,Save yo money and yo time,-1
4.5,It was all time the greats movie every,1
5.0,"OMG! THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING FROM BEGINNING TO END! I have this, I was supposed to watch this movie on 08/25/2021 but my husband and I got into a terrible motorcycle accident that day. When Harley Quinn's fight scene came up, I cried immediately. Because, (no joke) my husband is my Joker and I am his Harley Quinn. RIDE OR DIE. THE SUICIDE SQUAD MOVIE #1 IN MY BOOK.",1
1.0,"No, just no. 2 hours of disappointment.",-1
0.5,Horrendous waste of time. Even Margot Robbie couldn‚Äôt entertain me and she‚Äôs 10/10. 0-10 movie though.,-1
5.0,Better than the first one...,1
1.0,First movie was better. Somewhat entertaining but pointless characters and story line.,-1
4.0,Harlequin is the best!!! Although the bat is a better weapon- so ridiculous it was funny!!!,1
5.0,Very entertaining and funny! I really enjoyed the movie!!,1
5.0,Excellent. Once again director James Gunn does a fabulous job of movie entertainment.,1
1.0,"Were it not for Miss Robbie, the movie would be a farce. There is no real story line. It is all just blow stuff up and create the most unbelievable characters that ever existed. The first two Suicide Squads at least had some acting in it. This one fails dismally.",-1
5.0,Need more weasel please perfect amount of gore tho,1
5.0,"Great fight scenes, SO much better than the first one. Interesting characters, good gore, and had it‚Äôs funny moments. I really liked it a lot.",1

3.0,The seats could have been more Comfortable,0
4.5,So amazing! Especially if you watch it in theaters!,1
2.0,Definitely didn't wow me...it was entertaining in moments. Seen better movies...seen worse movies. Would not want to see it again.,-1
4.5,I liked the movie because I liked the movie. :),1
5.0,Loved it!! Very gory but also comical üòÅüòÅüòÅ,1
0.5,Never heard so much filthy language in a comic book movie. must have been written by a couple of high school boys. I walked out.,-1
2.0,"walked out, no plot, no sense made, I guess it is only for certain folks,",-1
4.5,"Awesome movie! Amazing what directors can do when given control over their movies. Fun, entertaining action with a ton of heart. Great to see another banger from Gunn!",1
4.5,I thought it was a great flick! There was a message behind it and it's to you to decipher it. Great action and plot. Bravo,1
2.5,Pete Davidson died in less than 30 minutes,-1
4.0,"Really great, entertaining movie. The graphic violence isnt for everyone, but the movie was overall entertaining with great twists and turns throughout",1
3.5,Very interesting story line just wish they used a more scary villain instead of a one eyed starfish went downhill towards the end good kid movie,0
5.0,Not my kind of movie but the grands loved it,1
1.5,"Too long, stupid plot but Harlequin was decent.",-1
3.0,"The plot felt rushed and establishment of character motivation was weak. It didn't pull me into that universe. Though some of the best parts of the movie were the humanizing moments that reinforced character identity - particularly with Harley Quinn. The action was decent. The FX were good. Some of the jokes landed but the F-bomb overkill was a significant unnecessary distraction. There were appearances made by a dong and some boobs, that lended little to the humor, to tintilation or to story. Three Ok's and two Meh's.",0
1.0,Na it was not that good,-1
5.0,I liked the way the sounds were used to perfect the ambience throughout the movie. It was also super funny,1
5.0,Best DCEU movie by a long shot. Please let James Gunn make more movies his way. And please give us more Harley and King Shark,1
3.5,lots of humor....fun movie,0
5.0,This was a funny movie! It was action packed and good storyline.,1
5.0,"If you enjoyed James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy movies, you should enjoy this -- a film not afraid to make fun of itself and its genre.",1
5.0,This Movies Will Definitely Be A CULT CLASSIC! The acting/characters in this movie were fantastic. Everything about this movie was great and i loved how quirky and weird it was!,1
5.0,Action and Comedy together made the movie great.,1
5.0,Awesome movie great action and hilarious scenes till the very end A+ for The Suicide Squad,1
4.5,It was a decent movie. Took 4 of our boys and their cousin... the language was a little more than I anticipated for kids but overall good movie,1
5.0,One of the dc movies out there,1
3.0,Tjj hi ought it was just ok. But my 12 year old son loved it. First suicide squad was better,0
0.5,"Terrible, ridiculous, bad, waste of time. Dumb concept, horrible script. I want my back!",-1
0.5,This was the worst movie ever!! Id say it isnt worth the money to rent it but in all honesty it is not worth the cost of electricity to watch it on your TV!,-1
1.0,It was just plain awful. No words. We left before it was over. And we are NOT picky movie goers. Just a weird one. Worst weve seen since Death to Smoochy.,-1
5.0,Me and my girlfriend really enjoyed watch this movie,1
2.0,"We are 70 years old, so action movies are not our typical genre. We sat through the whole movie nonetheless. The costumes and stunts were excellent. I like the all star cast. I did not know what the plot was. It was difficult to understand dialog.",-1
4.0,"Good overall, but a little hokie at the end. Otherwise great characters and fun surprises.",1
2.0,It was stupid! Had a few funny parts! Had we been home and turned it on we would have turned it off! Waste of money!,-1
1.0,"I cannot even comment on something I liked, that was stupid. It was nothing like the other one, waste of money and time",-1
5.0,I actually enjoyed the movie. My only gripe would be.........the Starfish.,1
4.0,I really like it for the type ofovie it was. It was dumb funny which we have not had in awhile and definitely made me laugh. The story was much better in this movie then the last one. It was defintely an outrageous action movie which made it a lot of fun.,1
3.0,gore highlight reel with a good story,0
5.0,Funny moments and lots of action.,1
5.0,This is a great movie. I loved every moment spent watching this!,1
0.5,"Geez, that was painful. I heard/read this was so much better than SS1. Nope. What a waste of an afternoon. My 18 year old son enjoyed it but he follows all these story lines and sees the value in what James Gunn made. I did not. After my son explained the reasoning behind some of JG's choices, I still don't see the value. Silly, juvenile. Can't even be 'suspend all belief', it's past that.",-1
0.5,Really like the first one. This was just a mess. Like they threw everything at it to see what would stick. It was just plain unnecessary.,-1
5.0,"Lots of off-the-wall humor. Good fun but not for little kids. Parents, this is not the MCU.",1
5.0,Suicide squad is a awesome movie.,1
5.0,Loved all the detailed gore!!! People getting ripped in half!! Also have a new found love for Harley Quinn!!,1
5.0,lots of action John Cena played a good role as long as the entire cast. not for young kids fair amount of swearing.,1
2.5,i like the humor in the movie cast are great. It's just the plot of the movie is just weak and silly. But the cast are great is just the whole plot of the whole thing.,-1
3.0,"I will go backwards. The last hour and ten min. of the movie was very action packed, fun and entertaining. I enjoyed it. However, starting from the beginning, the first hour was all over the place. There were too many characters introduced. There were not enough scenes with Harley Quinn & some of the scenes were poorly written with failed jokes. It was trying too hard to be funny. They should have done the whole movie based on how the last hour was written. For this reason I could only give it three out of five stars. I only enjoyed half the movie.",0
5.0,"The plot, the humor, the twists.",1
0.5,I could give this movie 0 stars I would. Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Honestly can‚Äôt believe I wasted money to see this movie,-1
5.0,"My daughter and I loved this movie, it was action packed and hilarious! one of my favorite movies we have seen in a long time.",1
1.5,"John Cena was horrible, he can't act why is he being put in movies. Awful!!!",-1
3.0,I really loved margot robbie as harley quinn obviously. king shark was cool. but the storyline is another forgettable suicide squad movie.,0
3.0,The first really had a better story but lots of comic book fun,0
5.0,It was better than I expected and I suggest everyone to view it especially if you viewed the first one this one is way better. Just be careful taking young kids because it is a lot of blood in it lol,1
4.0,went in expecting nothing. I saw the 2016 version and didn't care for it. I was curious what James Gunn could do as a director. I found the characters very likeable and the action gory and entertaining. I even liked the character arcs throughout the movie. highly recommend,1
4.0,James Gunn directed it so its what you‚Äôd expect. Funny af,1
5.0,This movie was so funny and amazing I was in love with this movie the whole time.,1
4.5,Very good movie! It was perfect still kinda bummed polkadot man and captain boomerang died,1
5.0,This Suicide Squad movie is a ten times better than that 2016 dumpster fire,1
5.0,loved all of the characters. special effects were great. great sound and songs. i hope they make another.,1
4.0,The fast action was great. This one was probably a little overly silly but still a fun ride.,1
3.5,"The Suicide Squad is a surprisingly brilliant take on Task Force X. The movie is fun and intentionally ridiculous so it‚Äôs more enjoyable. Everyone should have a good laugh with it. The characters are well written and make some of the most laughable DC characters interesting. It did a really good job with what is required in an ensemble movie by making every character an important part of the story. Going over the top doesn‚Äôt usually work but James Gunn‚Äôs creativity makes this a visually stunning cinematic experience with excellent cinematography, an all-star cast, and clever writing.",0
4.0,Great movie. Action was FAB. The characters vibe off one another. Can't wait to see it again!,1
4.0,Lost of action. Good story. Lots of blood and swaring,1
2.0,Was a bit off the rails for me. I enjoyed Harley Quinn's part and did laugh at the funny stuff. Maybe the first movie had my expectations too high.,-1
4.0,"Boundary pushing for dc actually it‚Äôs now the gold standard in their canon ie the DCEU bloodsport, ratcatcher bravo performances",1
5.0,I liked it. it was not expected and enjoyed every part of it.,1
5.0,"Action and bits of comedy, excellent.",1
5.0,funny and action packed.,1

0.5,Horrible movie. Waste of money and time.,-1
3.5,Liked the action. The excessive gore and crazy story line were meh.,0
5.0,Exciting throughout the movie! Loved it!,1
2.5,Weird after humorous first half. Lot more violence than I anticipated,-1
2.0,I did not enjoy as much as the first one. I would Raye a 4 out of 10.,-1
0.5,I do not like it it was boring,-1
5.0,"This movie is absolutely hilarious, action packed, and done right! Go watch this in theaters and show it some love becasue the creators deserve it.",1
4.0,"ridiculous plot but really a fun movie to watch. Good special effects, Margo Robbe really stole the show.",1
5.0,"Exciting adventure with none stop action. A bit gorey, but nothing too agregious. A good film all in a.",1
5.0,Hilarious and inappropriate!!! Loved it!!,1
4.5,Kooky and unexpected - have to buy into the absurdity and enjoy the fantastically random ride.,1
5.0,Good stuff. Really liked the Idris Elba character.,1
5.0,amazing Movie! Very hilarious! Waay better than the first. worth my time and money.,1
1.5,Stupid movie. Don't waste your time. Unnecessary characters made it worse (shark and weasel),-1
5.0,It was really good. Must see!,1
5.0,You just have to watch it,1
4.5,"Loved it, went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised.",1
3.0,I really liked Polka Dot Man,0
3.5,"Great action and humor moments. Way too much swearing and gore for a family movie (well duh, R rating...). As a fan of the old comics, it was a much better homage than the first one, but Ms. Waller was just stupid in some instances, not tough, and some of the things that made you want to watch were instead abused to the point of it being gratuitous and not enjoyable anymore.",0
5.0,A very fun and entertaining movie,1
5.0,"I loved the characters,acting and the action this movie was so amazing and funny everyone should watch this movie but don‚Äôt get too attached.",1
5.0,"Great movie! It‚Äôs got everything action, comedy, great cast!",1
5.0,Great story line and character development. Also very fun,1
2.0,"Started out funny, but ended up being stupid.",-1
3.5,"We really enjoyed the first Suicide Squad movie and we liked this one also, missed Joker, and was unaware that Stallon was just a voice, but overall we enjoyed it",0
4.5,This movie was pretty great! I would definitely recommend this to DC fans.,1
5.0,Great movie. A lot of action.,1
4.0,"Movie was fun, with really cool visuals.",1
5.0,One of the best movies I‚Äôve seen in a while. It was extremely entertaining throughout the entire run time. If you want something different than your run of the mill marvel superhero movies this is a must see.,1
5.0,The film had a lot of twists and held our attention through to the end,1
4.0,Lots of humor. John Cena was good. Not sure how I feel about the antagonist being a big starfish.,1
5.0,I watched it on HBO Max and like sit so much I had to see it in IMAX. The Lincoln Square AMC 13 has the best IMAX theatre in my opinion.,1
4.0,Silly seriousness :) Everything one might expect from the 'Suicide Squad'. Definitely a better done version of the first. Lot's of fun and great action!,1
4.5,It was great fun and full of action. had some very funny parts. I thoroughly enjoyed it.,1
3.0,it was action packed and full Hollywood effects but the villain and alien were underwhelming and plot was a bit boring.,0
5.0,I was initially worried watching this movie because of the cast chosen this time around but they did not disappoint. Awesome movie!!!,1
5.0,I wasnt really expecting much (especially following up the 2016 movie) but this was a really fun movie with great characters and a lot of heart. Highly recommend seeing in theater on a big screen.,1
4.5,Great movies but a bit too much back and forth for me.,1
4.5,Funny and action loved it,1
3.5,"It was good! All the scenes with Harley were a delight, I wish most of the new characters they introduce didn't have to die before the end of it though. also very gory which isn't a bad thing per say they were definitely excited for the R rating on the film, but It makes me think James Gunn misses making horror movies",0
4.5,Had some good humor in it...,1
4.0,Thought the first one was better,1
5.0,"Huge improvement over the 2016 movie. Characters actually have chemistry together, actually funny, the R rating gives it room to let the characters actually seem like villains, and Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn is an absolute delight.",1
3.0,"Cheesy and drawn out. if you haven't figured out how the movie ends by the end of the first our, good for you!",0
1.5,Story was all over the place. Humor didn't hit right. Shark guy was too dumb. Polka dot guy was cool.,-1
5.0,"It's a fun, visually interesting, funny movie. It's pretty gory though despite being a comic book movie, so be careful who you watch it with",1
4.5,Great movie! Lots of fun and laughs. Great action and good acting,1
5.0,loved everything. funny too,1
4.5,loved the show with how unpredictable it was especially King shark and the Weasel,1
5.0,"Loved it! First live action version of Starro was totally worth it alone :) Good story, way better plot than the first one and great cast!",1
5.0,it Was great this should Branch off from the dceu as The Sucide Squad Alternate Reality,1
3.5,Was alright but the first movie was better,0
4.0,I enjoyed the overall action of the movie.,1
3.0,I was not a fan of the plot with the Gian Star Fish and the Rats - it was a terrible Villain. There are so many villains in the DC Universe they could have gone with not sure they decided to make up their own. It made the story terrible,0
4.5,"Fucking hilarious, pretty vulgar but that made it better, James Gunn did it again.",1
5.0,"Great movie! Really enjoyed it. Didn't waste time, right to the action and funny throughout.",1
5.0,It was amazing and sooo funny 10/10,1
5.0,"First, its a fun movie with silly humor. Secondly, its a movie that can take away the stress of everyday society and let people relax to something strange and unusual, but fun.",1
5.0,Great movie with lots of action,1
5.0,Great movie! Even better with Dbox seats!,1
2.5,"Nice gore and blood , but movie was a little corny and story and plot were all over the board.",-1
4.0,"Funny, over the top violence, I got invested in a lot of the characters. I liked it better than the first one.",1
5.0,This is a must see. Action packed all through ‚Ä¶,1
4.0,"It was definitely not like the first one. That is a plus. Storyline was odd. Characters were good. It was interesting on the fact that some old characters were taken out, but they had new characters in place to carry on.",1
5.0,"The irreverent humor was great. The visual effects. Harley's ""flowers"" during her time in the presidential palace rocked. You MUST sit through the credits. It will be worth your time.",1
5.0,"Loved it, Harley Quinn always my favorite. Jemes Gunn did an amazing job writing and directing",1
3.0,"it was fine. a little bit better than the first one, but wasn't anything spectacular. definitely a fun watch, but I personally don't think I'd go out of my way to watch it again",0
3.5,it is very violent but very funny margot robbie was born to play harley tee he great flick i would watch it again,0
4.5,Perfect. I James Gunn.,1
5.0,"the shark, rat catcher",1
5.0,"Loved the movie, but our effects like water didnt work. They were turned on, it was a malfunction in the equipment. I was upset because I was taking a girl who never got to do anything and was excited for her experience. She has no mother and has lived with her elderly grandmother. Her home life is bad and Im trying to make it better for her. I was waiting for her to jump when the ocean splashed her but when she didnt I went over and discovered none of her effects were working for her and my sons seats. Shes had a rough time lately. In addition to her mother abandoning her, her father was just found found beaten to death and her father was just beaten to death. Im going to take her to an IMAX 3D movie as soon as one comes out, but I would like to take her to another 4DX as well so she can have the experience I intended. Thank you.",1
4.0,Definitely better than the first one,1
4.0,"Better than the previous one, real laughs and coherent story",1
5.0,Did not like John Sena in the movie,1
4.5,"Awesome, so much fun",1
5.0,"I love Harley! This movie was awesome, very entertaining and funny!",1
4.0,"It was better than I expected it to be, given that the first one was just okay. Bigger than the first and the R rating ensured more graphic violence which is always a plus.",1
2.0,Marketed several characters who were then killed very early and from there it was all caricature of blood and guts.,-1
5.0,I loved every second of it!,1
3.0,It was okay not as good as the first,0
4.5,"Weird, funny, crazy, ridiculous. Must watch!",1
2.0,The Starfish monster was just lazy writing- utterly uninteresting,-1
2.0,Was hoping the second movie would be better than the first. Instead this one was worse. To be fair I am not a fan of Deadpool and I feel like this had a lot of similar humor. Honestly couldnt wait for the movie to be over.,-1
4.0,My 13 years old loved it. It was fun watching for her. Im on the other hand saw deeper problem. Promoting killing for fun or sport isnt right. But that just my opinion. Overall kids will love it.,1
2.0,"It was ok, I was hoping to see more characters come together. I wanted to see on IMAX but now I know why they pulled it. Love Margo Robbie.",-1
3.0,Just wasn't as good as before. Some of the characters just didn't make it.,0
4.0,It was mindless entertainment.,1
5.0,Violent and Funny!!!,1
4.0,"Gunn did a great job with this movie, but there were some scenes that were hard to watch.",1
5.0,Good movie but definitely weird at times & a lot of inappropriate things that didn‚Äôt need to be in the movie.,1
5.0,It was amazing. There is a couple of parts that kinda made me mad but all in all a great movie.,1
5.0,"I liked the story, action along with the blood and guts ! Great movie",1
2.0,"Overly violent, brutal and gorey for no beneficial reason. Stupid. Did I say stupid? Thousands of people collectively worked on this? For what? They couldn't come to with a better idea before expending thus money and effort?",-1
3.0,Way better than the first movie. I was pissed about the characters that died but ultimately it was a good movie.,0
1.0,"The characters did a great job acting, but the movie was so cheesy. Extra nasty violence and nudity. I dont mind a little, but it was over the top. The first movie was good. This one was awful.",-1
5.0,was better than the last one,1
4.0,"Fun movie, very much liked it. Bummed by the death of Col. Flag, but enjoyed it nonetheless.",1
5.0,"A smart, funny and surprisingly thoughtful superhero(?) movie.",1
5.0,"not a fan of Mongal, T.D.K. love Harley. my son loved Sebastian",1
4.5,"Truly entertaining, funny, fun action and great cast",1
1.0,This was the worst. It‚Äôs like 5 guys in their 20‚Äôs got together and wrote this whole smoking weed. LMBOSMH ü§£ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,-1
1.0,Ridiculously stupid movie. Wish I could get my $15 back.,-1
5.0,"It wasn't really my kind of movie, I will say it was Unusual, But I want to be careful to not be overly critical of someone else's artistic interpretation of something ... You can tell there was a lot of passion and thoughtful work that went into the making of this movie and they were probably trying to cater to the tastes and preferences of a vast audience some thing that is very difficult to do !",1
4.0,It was good but dc could of used starro the conqueror for a bigger movie.,1
5.0,"Honestly might be my favorite super hero movie I've ever seen. Genuinely funny, doesn't take itself too seriously, and leans really heavy into comic book rules and logic. you can really tell they let the writers and director have a lot of fun. 10/10 absolute must see.",1
5.0,It‚Äôs a non-stop shotgun blast of fun inspired adrenaline! Everyone gets their moment to shine and it was so awesome! FOUR STARS!!!,1
1.0,It was to over the top in being ridiculous. It would have made for a good cartoon.,-1
4.0,Great movie. Action packed from the beginning and all around entertainment.,1
0.5,Terrible. Walked out,-1
5.0,Better than the original,1
5.0,"It was a very fun show to watch. Not serious at all, in a good way. Rat Catcher and Polka Dot Man were my favorite characters.",1
5.0,"Fun movie. I liked it! Harley, and the ü¶à are awesome!",1
5.0,A blast from beginning to end!,1
1.0,"The movie was one of the worse Ive ever seen. The screenplay was horrible. There were no interesting characters, it was full of bad acting & weak attempts at humor, making the film flat and dull.",-1
5.0,Awesome movie. James Gunn is a genius. Hopefully he starts making DC movies great again.,1
4.5,"It was exciting, funny and did not disappoint!!!!",1
3.5,Funny and entertaining.,0
4.0,Over the top in some places but worth a watch,1
4.0,"Much better that ""Suicide Squad"". A fun film.",1
4.0,Your review will help others decide whether to watch.,1
5.0,Great comedy-driven action!,1
3.5,"*NO SPOILER* Better character development than the first one. I feel some of the characters were under utilized. It would have served the film and it's gags better had some characters been rounded out. The films 3rd act was a little too silly. Overall, the movie was funny, and entertaining.",0
2.0,The first one was indescribably better,-1
1.5,The movie felt very bait and switch with many of the actors brought in for nothing more than a cameo. It also felt like one big running gag. You expect the movie to have some fun using mostly obscure villians but the 'humor' of it trying to poke fun its self was to much.,-1
5.0,"plenty of action, great people acting in it.",1
2.0,Didn't fare for much of it at all.,-1
5.0,I loved the Movie can't wait till the next,1
4.0,"Amazing cast, very funny, great story, maybe just a TAD too long though.",1
4.0,"Great action movie with heart and humor! I thought the last two with Harley Quinn were just ok, but this movie was much better, while still keeping her as a major character",1
1.0,Maybe kids would like it but as a 69 year old who likes action movies not do much,-1
5.0,fantastic tone. one of DCs best films,1
4.5,Second part of the movie is good )),1
0.5,"Lame humor, bad action, not an interesting storyline.",-1
5.0,NIGHT AND DAY DIFFERENCE FROM THE OTHER ONE!,1
4.0,it good action until the problem came out!1üòíüòía sea star really??,1
5.0,how the franchise should have started,1
4.0,It was funny. It had action. We liked the weasel and the rats. The weasel looked like our chihuahua with the crazy eyes.,1
1.0,"Plot jumped around, jokes that didn't land, and a Deadpool wanna-be. Don't waste your time.",-1
5.0,"It was very a very entertaining movie! It had its serious part and its comedic part, which blended perfectly!!",1
4.5,"Interesting, Good and Gory, and Very Fun Movie to Watch",1
2.5,Didnt like it !! Too much violence and characters seems to be trying hard to act funny and interesting.,-1
4.0,"Definitely the quirky side of the JLA. Im not familiar with the Suicide Squad, but Id like to see a story ark of how Superman was injured with the kryptonite bullet by whats his name",1
3.0,"Action packed, but I think the first one was slightly better.",0
2.5,Funny in places and the action was good but the anti-American messages took me out of the movie. The could have left that nonsense out and had an ok movie.,-1
2.0,"What the hell was that?! The acting was great, you have a few good giggles, butthat story lineUGH!",-1
3.5,"Movie was solid. Great special effect. Character development was was good, and you appreciated them in the end. The ending with the mythical monster was a little to hookie. None the less, enjoyable. The biggest negative was the theatre let about 7-10 kids under the age of 12 in the theatre... some as young as 5 ish. disappointed in the adullts with the kids... they were poorly behaved and loud.",0
4.0,"This movie was so much fun!!! I did laugh a lot & that's a good thing these days!!! I wasn't expecting so many characters to die, but the ones that lived were a hoot!!! There was a little too much blood letting for my taste, but otherwise I had a good time watching!!! It was definately a James Gunn film!!!",1
5.0,It was so good and funny we need to see more of this team,1
4.5,Felt like straight out of a comic. So much fun.,1
5.0,Story‚úîÔ∏è Directing ‚úîÔ∏è Edit and Character ‚úîÔ∏è,1
4.0,I had a blast it was so much fun best DC live action movie,1
4.0,Goofy fun all around!,1
4.5,"Very entertaining! Several plot twists, they did a great job filling so much time. Esp w/all that's going on right now/restrictions/etc. Could've lived without some of the vulgarity and nudity but it's whatever. Really would've loved to have seen it set in Gotham city. Think that would've helped with the darker DC aesthetic setting, but I understand it may not have been possible currently.",1
4.0,"The movie was action packed and had some interesting heroes. The villains were Harley and Death Stroke stole the show, as did Viola Davis who played an even better manic government lackey than she did in the first film. The monster was overly colorful and underdeveloped, but fit into the plot nicely. The Sharkman REALLY needs a retool. Hes too dumb and adds very little to the plot.",1
5.0,"good movie, much better than the original. go see it.",1
5.0,"Very good movie, we enjoyed it. Its great to be able to enjoy a movie even in times like what is happening.",1
5.0,So much better than the first suicide squad. James Gunn did a great job! Basically felt like a DC version of guardians of the galaxy.. so many good characters and they all had their time to shine. Great blend of action and comedy!,1
5.0,It had lots of action and funny at the same time.,1
1.5,It relied on Harley Quinn too much and the movie was cheesy with cheap laughs.,-1
5.0,"I enjoyed the duality of each character. Each character had there demons which made them villains, hence fitting them well within the Suicide Squad. However, they also had emotional backstories which drove the plot of the movie into something the audience could enjoy and connect with. It was funny, action-packed, and rightfully so.. gory! That made it all the more enjoyable to watch.",1
1.0,This was the dumbest movie I have ever seen. At no point did any of it form even one cohesive thought.,-1
4.0,Suicide squad 2 was pretty awesome. I loved the new character and the comedic timing of events. However I'm a little disappointed in the fact that there weren't alot of the original cast members. Other than that the movie is really good in my opinion.,1
5.0,Wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be a good movie but it was very entertaining,1
5.0,such a good movie.. I enjoyed it better than the first one actually.,1
3.0,Loved the special effects and the actin a good. The movie as a whole was pretty lame.,0
5.0,Funny and action packed,1
4.0,"Loved the action, and unpredictability, but sometimes there speeches went on a bit too long and a bit virtue signaling too",1
4.0,"If you loved the original and wanted more of the zany antics, you'll love this movie. If you hated the original movie and wanted a better superhero movie, you'll love this movie. If you haven't seen the original movie and want a great squad-based superhero movie that doesn't need world-ending stakes to make it good, you'll love this movie! A few odd moments of dialogue that felt forced are the only thing keeping this from a flawless 5 stars.",1
4.0,James Gunn does it once again. Makes you care for the characters you‚Äôve never thought of outside the comic books. Creating surprisingly meaningful and powerful C tier characters.,1
5.0,I felt like I was watching the boys it was so violent,1
1.0,One of the worst movies Ive seen. Zero plot line. Middle School humor.,-1
5.0,All of it was fantastic,1
5.0,This was hands down a great ass movie. Anyone saying it was bad has humor that's way to strict.,1
2.0,I did not care for the overall storyline. I also did not care for most of the side characters.,-1
1.5,Should have just brought back all the other actors along with the new ones,-1
1.0,they fought a giant Patrick Star in the end tho? im calling Spongebob.,-1
1.0,Insufferably stoopid. Waste of time and money.,-1
3.0,"Great music. Some fun nods towards fans. Good, but not great.",0
5.0,"Really really good!! Amazing visuals. John Cena stole the show, idris Elba and Margot Robbie gave great performances! King Shark was incredibly funny I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!",1
5.0,Great entertainment! Very pleasant atmosphere. Had a very relaxing and wonderful time.,1
4.5,very good all the way through,1
5.0,"Everything I wanted and more! The violence, heart, and amazing characters and funny dialogue made this a brutal and heartfelt film. JAMES GUNN ON ROIDS! BRAVO!",1
4.0,this is a pretty good movie. plenty of humor and action. a vast improvement over the studio's first pass at the subject.,1
4.0,"All around a great movie, pacing was a little off, but the action and characters more than made up for it.",1
5.0,Great use of characters who are not well known. Nanaue steals the show and everyone‚Äôs heart.,1
4.0,My son who is 24 absolutely loved it . I thought it was too bloody and a little silly. I would actually give it a 3 1/2 srars.,1
2.0,Terrible and about 45 minutes too long,-1
4.0,Love Harleys writing.,1
3.0,"The movie was enjoyable, but the Starfish was a little silly. I love the first Suicide Squad.",0
5.0,"I felt the movie was well done and blended comedy, action, and a comic book feel very well.",1
4.0,Great action movie. Some of the effects were a bit cheesy. Harley Quinn is great.,1
3.5,It was an entertaining movie hard to follow my granddaughter love it,0
5.0,This was the first the first dc movie I have watched since the Superman movies in the late 80s early 90s! This movie was done so well I love watching a movie in daylight and not in pure darkness like most DC movies are James Gunn is a phenomenal human being and put together the most awesome cast I can‚Äôt wait to see what happens next!,1
5.0,Very good and funny movie. It really outdid my expectations.,1
5.0,Amazing!! shark very cool!!,1
5.0,Amazing love the way they words on screen fit the scenario the characters were all fun too,1
2.5,It was entertaining and funny but a little cheesy .,-1
3.0,Too much gore for my taste. But at least it was enjoyable.,0
5.0,James Gunn delivered one of the most creative comic book movies as of recent years and it resulted in an absolutely beautiful film.,1
0.5,Absolutly loved first one this one sucked from beginning to end the storyline excessive comedy and way to much body parts slashing everywhere it‚Äôs good a couple but my god,-1
1.0,"Absolutely awful, worse than Old. I wish these guys would stop giving good reviews to movies just cause they're different. Massive waste of Idris Elba.",-1
0.5,The only thing good about the movie was the air conditioning on a hot day.,-1
4.5,"TheSuicideSquad So, yes, lets get this out of the way: The Suicide Squad is better than Suicide Squad. How could it not be? It's intense, it's insane, it's iaminlovewithit. Highly recommended on big screen ofcourse. Funny, smart, unpredictable & totally bonkers.",1
1.0,"Lots of action, gore and noise. The members of the suicide squad are all criminals and/or totally insane. They kill lots of people, mostly innocents, but the bad guys too, who, of course, need killing. The real bad guys (the U.S. government) get away with mass murder, and don't have to pay for their crimes, which sucks. The theme seems to be pointless violence and mayhem. Having lots of famous actors doesn't necessarily result in a good movie.",-1
2.0,Apparently even James Gunn cannot make a good DC movie. Was somehow more underwhelming than the last Suicide Squad movie. üëéüëé,-1
3.5,Great action The villian was a dumb choice,0
5.0,This movie is so badass and so much fun. We had a great time.,1
4.0,"fantastic, gory, brilliant special effects, an absurd films that ranks the best of the best in the dceu.",1
2.0,"Nothing great. Great sound, Harley was goodthats about it. Meh.",-1
5.0,Very fun movie! Loveable characters and totally hilarious! My only warning is to avoid watching if lots of gore makes you ill!,1
4.0,"It was a little slow in the beginning, but got better near the end!",1
5.0,Go see this movie in theaters. It has a lot of I didn't see that coming scenes. Much better than the frist one,1
5.0,"Hilarious! Great how all the characters played off of each other. It's pretty messy. but the carnage is so ridiculous, it's laughable.",1
5.0,Great action and entertaining characters,1
3.5,Definitely better than the first. And definitely not kidding when they call it Suicide Squad. Action and insanity galore.,0
4.0,"Unlike the 1st Suicide Squad, this one embraced the absurd, made if fun, and doesn't take itself too serious. Made for an enjoyable movie.",1
5.0,I really enjoyed this movie. It was way better than the last movie with the same name. It was funny and dark. Harley Quinn did an amazing job. I am glad they kept the same actress for that. Totally recommended!,1
0.5,"It was one long monotonous violent movie. This was the first S.S. movie I have seen and am glad I didn't waste my time or money on the previous. The great cast of actors is the reason I finally went to see this movie. I know this type of movie is aimed at a certain mental age group audience, I'm not it.",-1
4.0,Kinda Gourey...but kept your attention...,1
3.0,"Good plot, and excellent characters development, but way too much gore.",0

5.0,"lots of action, great movie",1
5.0,"Enjoyed every minute. Action, comedy, and great characters.",1
5.0,I loved it. It was so creative.,1
0.5,easily one if the worst movies I've ever seen!!!! handful of moments that make you chuckle but then yoy realize that you're laughing cuz it's sooooo bad!!!,-1
4.0,"It was ok, action with plenty of twist! A comic movie for sure!",1
4.0,I thought that the violence was graphic it was generally directed against individuals who deserved the violence (yes even more than the criminals that we are asked to pull for!).,1
4.0,"Unexpected twists, makes fun of superhero cliche's same way Deadpool did, overall pretty much just as expected for a DC flick, but with a few nice surprises :) 91% on RT is overblown... but i'd give it a solid 75.",1
0.5,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Try as I might to find some redeeming value. I could not. liked the first suicide squad. Made some sense. This was just stupid.,-1
5.0,"Loved it, super violent and funny.",1

5.0,really liked this movie alot of fun way better than the first,1
3.5,"Had to see this movie because of Harley Quinn, she makes the movie. The other characters did not disappoint either. Good humor, mixed with a lot of gore, well worth the money to me.",0
0.5,"Meh. Here we lose all the fun and tour de force moments of the first movie, with the exception of the Harley Quinn character. I was very disappointed, particularly given the superlative critic reviews‚Ä¶ perhaps the film is aptly named.",-1
3.5,The Harley Quin scenes were fantastic. The team and the plot were a bit hokey -- even for a hokey genre.,0
5.0,Movie was really well done and the cast was great. Hope there is more to come.,1
3.0,Good visual entertainment,0
5.0,Great Action pack movie üé• üçøüëçüèºüëçüèº,1
5.0,"Great Movie with Great Action and acting to back it up. Every character gets a moment to shine, the comedy is on point as is the pacing of the movie.",1
5.0,"I never bothered to watch the original Suicide Squad from 2016, but this movie was really fun to watch from start to finish. Every character introduced had me interested and it was really nice to see them use their powers. The Shark is my favorite.",1
1.0,It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It has now plot and too much cussing.,-1
3.0,"I enjoyed the comedy throughout. I expected gore, but that was just too much. The movie plot and acting however was superb.",0

5.0,"I liked pretty much all of it. It had plenty of great humor and the handful of deep, emotional scenes were done so well.",1
2.0,It was very entertaining to watch but compared to the first suicide squad it came no where close to being as good. The whole plot could have been a lot better along with the fight scenes. It was very funny though !,-1
5.0,I've seen this film five times in the past week. Had to get the IMAX Experience to celebrate this being the first R - rated film entirely shot with IMAX cameras. A heartfelt experience with a phenominal rogues gallery.,1
2.0,Discordant jumble. 7 movies edited into 1.,-1
5.0,"Great movie, funny and action-packed. Never seen any of the other movies in the series but might now.",1
4.5,I really liked this movie. It wayyyy better then it original one. (2016) I hope there is a sequel to this version of the suicide squad. I definitely recommend it.,1
5.0,"Boyfriend and I liked it. it was the classic suicide squad I love from the animated movies. we had kids in our theatre, it's not a kids movie by any means.",1
5.0,"The movie was a blast to see and makes right for all of the firsts wrong doings. I highly recommend seeing it in theatres, but if not at least on HBO Max",1
5.0,ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT !,1
2.0,"TOO MUCH! Too much blood, too much gore, too much swearing, not enough humor or characters that you like, care about and want to cheer for in this movie.",-1

5.0,Give idris Elba a golden globe,1

5.0,Amazing action packed movie. Highly recommend it.,1
1.0,Great movie to fall asleep in,-1

1.5,Only thing missing was Peace Maker giving Xi Jinping a blow job.,-1
3.5,Entertaining movie. Plot was a little bizarre.,0
5.0,Great movie!!! King shark was my absolute favorite! Definitely a must watch,1
4.0,"Definitely better than the first version released! Many really subtle jokes that were embedded in the dialog, great story line and special effects were good and not over the top.",1
3.5,"Interesting story like seeing some of the old guys back,",0
5.0,"In a movie that is so hyper-violent, it was a wonderful surprise to see how much heart was in the story. I was amazed at how much I came to care for each of the characters.",1
3.5,"I watched the first suicuide squad right before seeing this one. Although I was ""working"" watching the first one at home, i enjoyed the 2nd one!",0
3.5,"The movie was full of action, humor, special effects and surprises. Despite the fact that the central characters were ""bad people,"" the performances, directing and screenplay allowed me to like them. I would have preferred a less cartoon-like adversary at the end. Reminded me of Ghost Busters.",0
3.5,"Fun, lots of action! Could be a little over the top, but what do you expect from a group of comic book characters?",0
5.0,"Everything was well done, there seemed to be a few holes in the plot but still overall very good. Directing was very well done. Liked Harley Quin the best.",1
5.0,What I wanted out of a Suicide Squad film!,1
3.0,It was.... um.... er.... interesting?,0
5.0,"This movie did everything right that the last Suicide Squad movie didn't. Fun, creative characters going on a mission that suits them. Everyone is given time to discover their quirks and motivations. The cinematography is beautiful and the music works well. This is the best superhero movie I've seen in a while.",1
5.0,It was a pretty good movie. I would recommend it if you liked the last one.,1
4.0,Edgy and had themes from past hit movies. Lots of humor - some of it sick humor. If you don't like extreme violence and gore - this is not your movie.,1
5.0,The first half is the best dumb movie I've seen in a long time and the second half is even better,1
5.0,Awesome movie!!! Loved it,1
3.0,It was unnecessarily gory and the plot was ok but pretty predictable. I feel like the unnecessary gore took away from the plot a little bit I guess if youre into that kinda stuff.,0
4.0,Stupid starfish! But fun!!,1
5.0,So much fun. Finally got a Director who understands the characters that he is working with. These are not superheroes these are a bunch of weirdos and outcasts. This movie is funny and totally worth the time!,1
1.5,"It was bloody, gory, and much too violent! I didn't know what to expect and I had to leave after 30 minutes! Too much for me!",-1
5.0,"My daugther and I, Love it üéâüéâ",1
4.5,Balls to the walls action and gore. Great character development and just fun to sit through and enjoy.,1

5.0,Really awesome action and pretty good story. So much better than the garbage we got in 2016. Highly recommended,1
5.0,definitely recommended for anyone who loves DC Comics heroes and villains team ups!!!!,1
4.0,"superhero movie that gives you something different, but loses steam starting in halfway.",1
3.0,"Action, action, action. Eldris Elba is great to watch as usual. And Harley Quinn is the best. Some campy spots and director choices (like Milton). Lots of gore!",0
3.5,"Good, funny characters. Liked the plot and the chemistry between the actors. As long as you don't mind the gore, definitely a fun watch.",0
1.0,"Sorry this was a horrible movie! Too much violence, profanity, and no plot! Harley Quinn was the only good thing in this movie! DC needs to get it's act together! DC will never beat Marvel in the movies!",-1
3.0,remember: It's a comic,0
4.0,it was really funny and gory but not in a disgusting way. great movie.,1
4.0,This movie was entertaining from beginning to end!,1
5.0,"I really enjoyed this film. had a good balance of action & humor & a factor I want expecting was the emotional element. I got invested in these characters (some more than others) & genuinely cared about them & their journey. Found myself getting very invested for long stretches at a time. There were moments that didn't stick as much as others, but the majority of the film was expertly crafted. Much better than I expected, a pleasant surprise. Go in with an open mind & enjoy the ride!",1
5.0,There is NOTHING to dislike. HARLEY QUINN IS PHENOMENAL. James Gunn did an incredibly amazing MASTERPIECE.,1
3.0,"Somewhat entertaining, but was a little stupid",0
3.0,"Some editing issues, and a few jokes fell flat, but it was a fun summer movie.",0
5.0,Lots of violent fun with some touching scenes. A big improvement over the first one.,1

5.0,Very entertaining. Action packed with some laughs. definitely a good watch,1
5.0,It‚Äôs a lot of fun. Not a movie to take seriously and you‚Äôll have fun.,1
3.5,"My daughter and I enjoyed watching it, but I had to cover her eyes and ears at selective moments in the movie. Overall, it was okay.",0
5.0,"Harley Quinn is one of my favorite characters and she did not disappoint! I enjoyed the movie, it definitely has some rated R stuff the movie was overall kid friendly",1
5.0,Amazingly hokey! Loved it!,1
5.0,Amazing! Best comic book movie to date. James Gunn really capture the essence of the characters in a fun way and really did a good job of showcasing the DC universe.,1
5.0,"Great movie, action packed, funny humor, only a little bit of slow parts that slowed the pace but overall enjoyable movie.",1
5.0,"Brilliant, hilarious, whacky. Just intense amounts of fun and HEART. Harley has never been written better, and James really put so much emotion and love into this.",1
1.0,"This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen who comes up with this shit, I walked out 1 hour into it üò≥",-1
5.0,"Great characters, great story. Dont get attached but get attached at the same, must see it on the big screen!",1
5.0,"Forget the first movie- this one is hands down the absolute best. Worth the entire 2 hours 30+ minutes of your life, touching scenes surprisingly, great acting",1
4.0,Ridiculously absurd and entertaining!,1
5.0,It was amazing I loved it,1
5.0,It was a fun movie to watch and it felt really good to be back in the theater.,1
5.0,Very good. Liked better than the first movie. More homes and comedy to keep it light w all the blood gore and death. Would watch again!,1
5.0,"James Gunn at his very best! This film is like the bastard offspring born from the Deadpool and The Guardians of the Galaxy movies, if they had a toxic relationship. In a good way! Also, this is a film is a hard R. Like pushing NC-17 R. Don‚Äôt take kids. Seriously.",1
1.0,not what I thought it would,-1
2.5,was boring most of the time especially a fucking starfish stupid,-1
3.5,"movie was good for the most part, a lot of action, good comedy, great special effects, good storyline but i was hoping for much more. The main fight scene was with a DC character I don't care much for. DC needs to come up with better villains' for their superhero movies. They have a much larger and better selection of bad guys to choose from stop giving us second rate bad guys. Other than that movie was fun and entertaining.",0
1.0,"Big explosion, gore and lots of death CAN NOT cover up a missing story. This movie gave me no reason to care at all. Whatsoever. I got bored with the kills and explosions. I wanted a story to care about",-1
4.5,"I liked how darn funny it was, brutal until the end. Very entertaining.",1
5.0,Everything you can ask for in a movie. Amazing moments that make you do a whole 180* in emotions in a span of seconds. Definitely check this out in the biggest screen in the theater!!,1
0.5,Character profiles were way too silly!,-1
5.0,Please go see this! Support it! One of my fav DC movies!,1
3.0,"I can‚Äôt say which I thought was a better film, this or the original? Both are average and seem with little to no backstory. Right now it‚Äôs doing very poor at the box office and it might be long time before the next script for this franchise ever gets a green light.",0
5.0,This movie was pretty cool!!!! A must see!!!!,1
5.0,Its worth seeing John Cena die.,1
1.0,"Far too gratuitously violent for a ""comic book movie"", apparently in an attempt to horn in on the success of The Boys, but a miscalculation in tone. The gore is only marginally funny once or twice, and then becomes oppressive. There are maybe four moments in the entire running time that are indicative of what this movie should have been. Most of them involve Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, who should have gotten a lot more screen time. The Idris Elba character is essentially exactly like the Will Smith character in the first Suicide Squad, down to the plop device of using his daughter as leverage to get him to join the team. Starro the Conqueror is too sympathetic, not to mention unintentionally unthreatening once it gets out on the street and is stomping around like the Sta-Puft man (or maybe it was intentional - hard to tell what Gunn was trying to do with this thing). I was really looking forward to seeing on screen portrayals of some of the DC Universe's notoriously odd characters, like the Peacemaker and King Shark, but in the end I they were ill used. The plot was unnecessarily convoluted, eye-rollingly so. So much wasted potential here.",-1
0.5,Sub par story and the acting was terrible. Bar far the worst comic book movie except for the first suicide squad. Good special effects dont make a good film.,-1
2.0,"Because of the high ratings i was expecting more like the caliber of Guardians of the Galaxy or the Infinity series etc OR at least entertained like the first one...Nope, fell short. Characters un engaging, with the exception of Harley in a few good action scenes. The main star fish villain too added to the unrealistic plot. It never gained momentum with the charaters and the story line..bummer. By hour 2, I was hoping it would end.",-1
4.0,"fun movie, plenty of action, great special effects. the monster was a bit on the silly side.",1
5.0,Great humor and non stop action with great characters,1
4.5,Didn‚Äôt like Jon Cena dying. Loved seeing him in recovery at the end of the listings.,1
1.0,The foul language was outragous! I should have walked out of the movie!,-1
4.0,"Big, loud, gross and vulgar‚Ä¶loved nearly every second of it. So much fun!",1
4.0,great movie just like the last. new characters fit right in.,1
5.0,Loved it... action packed and comical all in one. Highly recommend it.,1
2.0,Funny at first but got worse the longer it went on not worth the money,-1
4.5,PLEASE make more R rated comic book movies! Love what Sean Gunn did with this!,1
4.0,Very comical & action packed,1
1.0,Too bloody (gratuitous) and the foul language was too much. I don't mind a little bit of cussing when it fits the plot line and the same with some gory scenes but this was just over the top and senseless. It took away from the flow and the storyline. Very disappointed.,-1
4.0,"Lots of Vulgar language! Bits of comedy throughout. Would see again, but not in a theatre!",1
3.0,The starfish thing was a bit too much,0
5.0,my kids and I loved it cant wait for the next one :),1
3.5,did not like the giant starfish???but lots of hardcore action,0
4.0,Movie was darn good. I thought the music was the greatest,1
2.5,"Below average script, only kept in the cinema for Mr. Elba - very good effects and dramatic scenes - borderline entertainment.",-1
3.5,"It is a fun action flick but not one of the memorable superhero flicks. Over the top as you would expect. Heavy on the comedy, and violence is graphic. Entertaining.",0
3.5,Funny characters-lots of action -equal amount of drag.,0
4.5,"I thought this movie was 100% better than the original. The ""R"" rating helps. I loved the action and comedy, and the way the movie is shot to tie in all the simultaneous scenes throughout the movie. I found that I really cared about the characters. Hint - you need to stay through the entire Credits for the last scene.",1
0.5,I cant believe those actors actually choose to do this movie. First movie I walked out of. Awful.,-1
5.0,Fun movie all the way through.,1
5.0,"A funny, light hearted superhero movie, with good action.",1
4.0,"It's a fun movie. Don't expect too much as far as sticking to the comic books, or at least reasonably explaining some of the silliness, but just take it as what it is. King Shark was probably my favorite character. Having Stallone doing the voice was a perfect choice.",1
5.0,It was funny and entertaining! It was very comic booky. Tons of action scenes. Fairly violent. Not for kids.,1
1.0,"Horrible. An overgrown starfish with a huge eyeball threatening mankind...really?! It was slow, with a terrible plot, sprinkled with tasteless adult content that further diminished any hope for this movie. Harley Quinn's character was the only bright spot in this film.",-1
2.0,"Some action, but almost cartoonish at best. Lack of a real plot and everyone comes back to life? just a setup for suicide squad 3... The 1st movie was better, beats sitting at home though :)",-1
5.0,It was fun with plenty of action. The dialogue is full of jokes. Great time.,1
5.0,Funniest Movie of the year,1
3.0,funny that's about it,0
5.0,"Best time I've had watching a movie in years! It's hilarious, excessive, bloody and has heart. Movies like these is why I love superhero movies no matter if you're Marvel or DC fan this has something for everyone!",1
5.0,"Comedy, action, dialogue and acting were phenomenal across the board. I highly recommend seeing it in theaters.",1
5.0,"Dear God, I love the Suicide Squad",1
5.0,Awesome from beginning to end!! And I hated the first one But since there aren't a lot of movies out right now it seemed like a decent choice. DC is starting to finally find their thang.,1
5.0,Great movie fun for kids !,1
2.0,"Poor writing, poor cinematography. Depth of character were shallow.",-1
3.0,"Hey i couldn't really concentrate on the movie because there was a group of kids just talking in the rows infront of me. I was liking what i saw though, maybe a watch again some day. But i couldn't really enjoy because of all the noise being made in the theatre.",0
5.0,"Twists, action, comedy!",1
5.0,"THE single best DC movie, one of THE best superhero movies EVER. I was belly laughing so much this movie and my other emotions were pulled every other moment. the cinematography was great, writing was spot on, and is THE perfect movie to kick off going back to theaters post-pandemic. this is a must see for dc fans, movie fans, and anyone else as well who might not be either... doesnt take knowing much to love this movie either. 15/10",1
4.0,It was humorous and serious at times!,1
5.0,Such creative and unending entertainment and cinematography.,1
3.5,"It was action packed - which I liked. But there was a TON of blood and gore, which I do not prefer but, others will like that feature. There are many stars in this movie with much death and destruction. It was a good movie.",0
5.0,"I honestly did not know what to expect after some people came back unsatisfied. I will say that I personally had a great time watching this movie. One critic mentioned how this movie polders from other movies, making it a mess. Well I guess they probably hate Tarantinos movies too because so do they. But like Tarantino, this movie brings me reminders of the nutty independent action movies of the 60s-70s. The sort of movies which werent too popular at the time of release, but became legendary over time. I saw this movie m, maybe not legendary, but I had a great time as this was my first movie in almost 1.5 years. Ironically the last movie I saw before the pandemic hit was Harley Quinn, so this was fitting. Sad that it didnt score more at the BO, I feel like I want more. It was fun, and the characters were overall great. Again, might not be for everyone but at least for me I had a damn good time back at the movies. Try to enjoy on the big screen if you can!",1
4.0,"Really fun, absolutely worth your money",1
5.0,Well done. Unexpected twists and turns!,1
5.0,"Fantastic performances by the entire cast, especially Idris Elba and Margot Robbie",1
5.0,Better then the first one,1
4.0,What the first movie should have been and more. I need a sequel!,1
4.5,A lot of fun. Finally another win for DC,1
5.0,All I gotta say is James Gunn I love you for this movie,1
5.0,"Being a huge DC fan of the Suicide Squad comics, I have to say without a doubt that James Gunn is a legend. The time and effort he has put into making this movie has definitely payed off. Margot Robbie portrays a badass Harley Quinn! Idris Elba, Viola Davis, John Cena, and everyone else absolutely nailed it! Full of surprises, action, violence, and emotion. Amazing storytelling!",1
3.5,"Teenage content, but exciting with exploding Bodies.",0
5.0,"Great action! Lots of funny inserts. Good characters. A little disappointed that Harley didn't have a bigger role, but as always, she ruled what she was given!",1
5.0,I enjoyed it very muchü§ò,1
4.0,Funny and Entertaining,1
3.0,It seemed like a bunch of nonsense put together for a little bit of entertainment. If it wasn't for Harley Quinn it would have been much worse. It wasn't quite as bad as what everyone is saying. If they would stop watching all of the trailers they wouldn't be quite as disappointed. They see half the movie (the good parts) beforehand and get super hyped.,0
5.0,The perfect comic book movie. Everything I wanted from this movie was here and more. Amazing.,1
4.0,Really enjoyed it. Super funny but slow at times,1
4.0,Action scenes were good overall. First 15 minutes were not pleasant though.,1
3.0,"Its true to the comics. I just thought that certain scenes were made perfectly and some scenes were hilarious but as a whole the film was kind of mediocre. A lot of it was just gratuitous shock value and wasn't clever. John Cena. Margot Robbie, and Viola Davis all did a great job.",0
1.0,Just terrible. Felt like all they were trying to do was make a rated R Guardians of the Galaxy and it was just horrible.,-1
5.0,So much fun action and tons of gore. Hilarious dialog and had James Gunn all over it. I finally can say I appreciate a DC movie again.,1
3.5,"Nothing could ever top the original Suicide Squad, but it was entertaining enough in the same type of setting. Its one of those you have to suspend reality movies, but it was good. Harley Quinn delivered as always!",0
0.5,"Horrible movie! We left about 20 minutes into the show. The characters are weak, too much violence, and the humor is rude and juvenile. Not to mention that John Cena is the worst actor in the history of film. Don‚Äôt waste your money.",-1
1.0,Boring! i actually fell asleep for a few minutes several times. The Gun was not even shooting blanks it was empty Wish i could get my money back,-1
2.5,Not compelling enough to be a intense move and not funny enough to be a satyrical movie,-1
2.0,Nothing like first movie. Very corny,-1
5.0,Great humor and action,1
2.5,"Ok movie with bad acting. John Cena was really, really bad, won't go see another movie with him in it.",-1
3.5,Better than. The first movie. It‚Äôs a bit gory I would say,0
2.0,Spectacle for spectacles sake. No emotional buy-in. Would I want a sequel? Probably not.,-1
2.0,"This movie was good for a half dozen laughs or so, and it wasn't a complete waste of my two hours, but I can't see anyone who isn't at least a moderate fan of the DC Universe finding anything enjoyable about this movie. Two out of five stars save it for a rental and watch it at home!",-1
4.5,Very creative and fun. the jokes land and actually has some emotional weight. The last suicide squad doesn't deserve to even share the same name as this movie,1
5.0,"Loved the action, surprises, the comedy and the characters...... especially the Rat. SPOILER........STAY till the credits are OVER!!",1
4.0,It was better than I expected! It was also funny. It was a bit gruesome. I would recommend watching!,1
2.0,The shark was funny. The rest was just loud and gratuitous.,-1
4.5,"I liked most of the movie, didn't like that they killed off one of the characters.",1
4.5,really fun movie for the most part. do not bring your kids,1
5.0,Incredible! Absolutely hilarious! Maybe best DC movie ever!,1
3.0,I thought it was action paced & comical in a great way.,0
5.0,Makes full use of THE BiG SCREEN -- see it in the theatre on the biggest screen you can!,1
4.0,Started out at the beginning with action and a lot of humor. Creature at the end a was a little silly.,1
4.0,Felt like a true Suicide Squad story with characters you can get invested in and plenty of violence that is expected with this property. King Shark and Starro the Conqueror looked amazing as well. Definitely recommend to comic and James Gunn fans. Casual fans as well if they can keep an open mind.,1
5.0,"completely new take on the idea amazingly executed, a bit sad about the deaths of certain characters , but over all love it",1
3.0,"Reminded me of the Godzilla movies from long ago, except in color.",0
4.0,I actually found this movie funnier than the first.,1
1.0,"i'd like a full refund, worst movie i've ever seen only your site gives is 94% ratings? I want a refund or I'm going thru my bank for a chargeback.",-1
4.0,Fantastic and refreshing,1
5.0,"Hyper fun movie. All the characters are fun and interesting. King shark, Sebastian, and ratcatcher 2 were my favorite. Harley action scene was the best. Starro the Conqueror!!!!!",1
5.0,James Gunn is a genius!!,1
2.0,It was kind of slow in the middle I almost fell asleep.,-1
2.0,"A giant starfish?? really??? the superheroes were HOOORIBLE and the villain was even worse! they even set it up for another after the credits! I can't wait to not watch the sequel!! I laughed sooooo hard when the Weasel drowned and when they didn't know who Milton was. besides that, that's 2hours of my life that I'll never get back! that's the only reasons I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.",-1
3.0,"I‚Äôm very critical of boobies, and this one turned out to be surprise. I expected more of the same on the first one and instead it was a comedy similar and make and model from others other genre in the Marvel universe. The way the story is told is also charming going back and forth playing the expedition of things that of happened already in the viewers eyes. Grizzly and funny as well as way over the top! Stand out performances for The Actress playing Harley Quinn. Just a fun movie not for the faint of heart!",0
0.5,"I watched suicide squad it sucked! I was falling asleep, it reminded me of a low budget movie",-1
5.0,We really enjoyed it.,1
2.5,"Fun moments are outweighed by the endless attempts at slapstick humor, shock value moments and attempts to get you to sympathize with characters. I thought I was going to see an action film. Got baited and switched into a clown show. Left the theater after a certain character saves themself. Disappointing....",-1
5.0,Great action and good story!,1
0.5,It was better than the first movie. But it wasn't that great. I got bored and figgity quick.,-1
0.5,"It was terrible, needless butchering-couldn‚Äôt follow any plot that you weren‚Äôt distracted from because of all the gore! We were excited to see it because of the cast but I ended up being embarrassed for them to be in such a poor film. We walked out.",-1
5.0,i LOOOOOOOVED dis Movie!!! Halarious!!!! and wiLLLLLLLd!!!!,1
2.5,Most of the humor fell flat for me and there were multiple instances where the characters made bizzare choices. Most of the action was good and I did have a chuckle or two.. It was OK.,-1
3.5,"Lotsa jokes and action, too many dead bodies.",0
3.0,It was different. Had its fun. Just a little too much dumb humor and bad plot to overcome in parts. Great performances from a bunch of people. Harley Quinn stays undefeated.,0
2.0,I literally got a headache midway through. There‚Äôs just so much noise and shallow character work that left be bored out of my mind.,-1
5.0,Non stop action what the first one should have been.,1
4.0,Way better than the last one.,1
0.5,"I was hoping a new director who made Guardians of the Galaxy vol 1 & 2 so great could FINALLY make a DC movie that was worth watching... I was wrong. I'd say the DCU just isn't my thing, but my mother told me not to lie. Really, DC, it's you not me. don't waste your time.",-1
3.5,It was funny but it stepped away from the first movie quite a bit and I actually liked that one. There were times where you were wondering what was going on.,0
0.5,"Horrible, disjointed, seems like they were making it up as they went along! Same old same old.",-1
4.5,"The Suicide Squad is simply James Gunn doing what he does best: taking a group of relatively unknown characters, putting them up against an almost insurmountable threat, and making audiences fall in love with them through brilliant writing and directing. I hope he continues to make movies for both Marvel and DC.",1
3.0,"It was over kill & not for kids , plus a little slow.",0
4.0,Great fun at the movies,1
0.5,Disliked everything. My friend and I agreed that this must have been dreamed up by a bored 13-year-old pubescent boy.,-1
4.0,"I've seen every martial arts movie that's worth watching. so to me this movie was mid in that realm. but as for a marvel movie it was really good. funny but not stupid. the action was well practiced, although sometimes a little too obvious. still, it didbita job making me like a character and world that we aren't as familiar with.",1
4.0,"solid film with great action, weaker on the plot and final fight but it was entertaining enough to not hinder the film. can't wait for a sequel!",1
5.0,fast fun and great story,1

4.5,"One of the top-tier Marvel movies - it takes the typical MCU elements and improves on them by adding actual martial arts (VFX-enhanced, but none of the leads have to let the CGI people do the heavy lifting!), and course-correcting after the misstep of casting a White Woman as an Asian Man by having a majority-Asian cast. Simu Liu as Shaun aka Shang-Chi is marvelous as the Americanized Chinese slacker dude whose equally Americanized slacker gal pal Katy (Awkafina) is shocked to discover is also a superhuman(?) martial artist with some really extreme family issues. After an amazing fight on a San Francisco city bus with several ruthless hit men, he takes off to Macao, with Katy insisting she has to go along to ""protect"" him(!), to warn his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) that he believes his father is trying to kill them. Turns out Xialing hasn't forgiven him for abandoning her as a kid - and their father Xu Wenwu's (Tony Leung) seemingly vicious behavior is a LOT more complex than Shaun is originally willing to believe.... While Marvel's embrace of martial arts superheroes in the Seventies often had about as much depth as Rudy Ray Moore had, and their grasp of Asia and Asians was straight out of Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu books (he was originally Shang-Chi's father - because That's Not Racist at ALL!), at their best they introduced American audiences to a wider view of heroes and heroic behavior as well as of the motivations of ""villains"". (It wasn't just martial artists - at that time The X-Men became a metaphor for xenophobia, and Magneto went from mustache-twirling villain to concentration camp survivor antihero.) Xu Wenwu might be the MCU's most engaging supervillain since BLACK PANTHER's Eric Killmonger - a seemingly immortal conqueror who fell in love with a female fighter who could defeat him in hand-to-hand combat, and for her tried to mend his ways until his past caught up with them. He's more Michael Corleone than Fu Manchu knockoff, and when he discovers how his need to bring his wife back to them backfires on him spectacularly it's hard not to feel sad at the waste. In place of their mother Li (Fala Chen, seen only in flashbacks), Shaun and Xialing get to meet her sister Ying Nan played by the great Michelle Yeoh, who's been aging beautifully before our eyes without losing any of her incredible physical skills. (Watch STAR TREK: DISCOVERY, where she's often the only good thing about the show, and keeps up with the younger cast brilliantly!) The climax, while entertaining, is a lot of the usual ""Insert actors into DVFX"" stuff, but at least the Big Bad here feels like it comes out of Chinese folklore rather than the fevered macho genius of Jack Kirby - er, ""Stan Lee"". If you like any form of ""Kung Fu Movie"", you'll love SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS.",1

5.0,Great movie. Will definitely watch again.,1
4.0,"Enjoyed the movie for the most part, a bit slow in the beginning and either I missed it or they didn't show the actual origin of the rings. A big bonus on my part is my wife didn't fall asleep which she usually does so that right there says it was an interesting movie to me!",1

2.0,Too Long And Uneventful,-1
5.0,Matt Reeves knocks it out the park.,1

5.0,one of the best Batman movies ever made,1
5.0,This is the real Batman movie we‚Äôve all been waiting for. Everyone killed their roles!,1
5.0,this movie was better than I thought and I liked that it was down to earth and feel more like the animated series. beyond the one political line that was forced into the film thr movie was great,1
4.0,a little long but very great movie,1
4.0,awesome movie! I love how dark and emotional it was. James Gunn would never make a movie this raw and gritty,1
5.0,Brilliant film noir. The Batman was done very well,1
5.0,I loved it from beginning two end. I love comics,1
4.0,"Great movie. Great CGI and practical effects. Acting was mostly all good. Riddler I couldn‚Äôt take though. Performance needed to be reeled in a bit, it was uncomfortable whenever he would lose it. It just sounded whiny and unreal. Plot line was great. A great follow up to the Bale Batman movies. Excited to see more.",1
5.0,I like azreal batman from the knightfall saga,1
5.0,Robert Pattinson is The Batman!!! Cinematography was at its finest. Best movie of the year.,1
4.0,I love the realistic approach to Batman!,1
4.0,The world's greatest detective finally has a movie helping prove why that name is an apt one for The Batman. A well crafted and masterfully executed piece of Comic Book cinema. Only issue was the poor decision to make Selina Kyle the daughter of Carmine Falcone for some reason.,1
2.0,Not good. Long and dry.,-1
5.0,Batman goes slumming and we're all the better for it.,1
3.0,Emo Batpat vs usual nutcase villains in a bleak city where nobody would want to live,0

5.0,Better than the dark knight?,1

3.0,Everybody but Robert Patterson was good. Should of found someone that could act and looked better.,0
5.0,best batman since a dark knight,1
5.0,I really enjoyed watching this movie. Robert Pattinson did a great job as Batman.,1
3.5,Not bad!!! Would definitely recommend.,0
5.0,Great film. Next to Dark Knight as te best batman movie.,1
5.0,Real life problems like crooked politicians and lots of action. The DC area should watch this movie.,1
5.0,It was a new/different take on the many versions of the Batman. Robert Pattinson did a great job as the Dark Knight. Id pay to see the movie again just to see the Batmobile! That sucker was a beast of a car and something I would imagine a Hero who's main thing is intimidation to be driving! GO SEE IT!,1
2.0,Relentless dark colors and grim themes. Confusing plot that I didn't care about. I don't think I like the Batman franchise in general.,-1
2.0,boring movie fell asleep through some of it. he is definitely not better than Ben as Batman. hopefully Ben can get a movie. definitely should not have done this one.,-1
3.0,Not bad. Solid 6.8/10,0
4.0,It‚Äôs a solid Batman movie. I enjoyed it.,1
3.0,Waaaaaaaayyyy too long! The entire climax needed to be edited out entirely.,0
5.0,Great movie villain kinda weird though,1
0.5,very disappointed with the film,-1
5.0,Nice presentation of a classic story.,1
4.0,"The most dark and gritty depiction of Gotham city by far. You can feel the city is in desperate need of a hero. I have never seen a Batman that has been so brooding and brutal on-screen before. The film is like a neo-noir superhero film and the story just sucks you in with its detective style. The entire cast did a great job with a great job with bringing these characters to life. As well as, Matt Reeve's giving the audience some great shots of the city and some cool action sequences. I really can't wait for the next chapter in this new Batman trilogy!",1
4.0,"I enjoyed this movie. I had heard a lot of negative reviews prior to viewing. This production is different than most Batman movies... much darker. Reminded me of The Crow. But overall, very enjoyable. Did not seem like a 3 hour movie to me.",1
3.0,"Everything aside from Batman and Catwoman was great. The movie would've been much better without them. Had it been limited to James Gordon solving the crime, it may have been a masterpiece.",0
5.0,Outstanding but a little long,1
5.0,One of the best Batman films ever,1
2.5,Some good stuff. Some boring stuff. 50/50 movie.,-1
4.0,"I really enjoyed this movie, mostly for its grittiness. Honestly, this is the only Batman live-action film that made me care for the man himself as well as the caped superhero persona. The approach of the film felt as fresh as a Batman story could be but manages to maintain the core of what makes it a Batman/Gotham story. I really liked it.",1
4.5,"Pace, acting & character build up. Riddler portrayal Batsuit, car chase is on par with Dark Knight if not better",1
5.0,"It's a breath of fresh air to Batman's cinematic portrayal and to filmmaking as a whole. I went in thinking ""the bar for an interesting Batman film is on the floor"" and then left the theater feeling so exhilarated and excited over a character I haven't cared about in decades. This film reignited a joy for the process of filmmaking that's been lost to me in recent years. While a number of films that gain publicity are entertaining and fun, many of them feel generally uninspired or forgettable (particularly in anything that isn't the writing or acting). The Batman stays consistent in it's themes and actually utilizes the environment to propel its story in a revivifying way. The city of Gotham actually feels like a place with a history to care about. The combination of the layers of sound and the distinctive lenses used add immensely to the mood and ambiance. The use of lighting accentuates the atmosphere and provides in tone what I usually only notice from the music composition. All of this is able to be interpreted by audiences peripherally without forcing everyone to sit through a boring exposition instead. Truly, there's so much care and thought put into the writing, sound design, cinematography, music composition, lighting and costume/set design that it's palpable. There's so much I could write an essay on it. Overall, I wish more film studios would step it up and allow the creative teams to work with more originality to achieve their own unique visions. The Batman might seem long, but it ties up a lot of its loose ends nicely and leaves the audience feeling generally satisfied. It's a good movie to watch for a casual film fan and a great one to watch for a Batman fan.",1
5.0,Loved Robert Pattinson as Batman he pulled it off well,1
4.0,"At almost three hours, it is a bit long, but we wound up enjoying it for the various elements. It is an action movie, but also a detective story with elements of suspense and romance. Robert Pattinson was a better Batman/Bruce Wayne than I'd anticipated. It wouldn't have been a bad movie, even without the Batman character but I'm a bit of a comics geek, so I enjoyed that part of it, too.",1
5.0,"Approached with a fresh set of eyes. This motion pictures applies a rhythm that may seem slow at first but justifies the growth of the character through out all of it's act's. Matt Reeve's flawlessly introduces to us in a refreshing way beloved character's from the Batman universe, in such a way that it does not feel like a repeat of past event but a telling go a new chapter. If you haven't seen it in theaters I suggest your purchase or rent the film to watch at home!",1
3.0,"Too long, action not evenly dispersed.",0
5.0,I liked how batman was presented so dull,1
4.5,"Really fantastic film. I know a lot of people are expecting a high octane, action superhero film, but The Batman brings the iconic character back to his roots as a young detective as the comics have always portrayed. It's a suspenseful thriller with a superhero lead, and it came out beautifully. Some points seem long and dragged, but every detail is worthwhile. Definitely more for the die-hard Batman comic fans, but still pleasing to those looking for a great overall movie.",1
1.5,Didn‚Äôt like anything about the movie... too long.. characters changed.. boring.. not worth watching..,-1
3.5,"The New Batman movie was definitely ""Darker"" then past ones. That being said the story line was good, character build up was OK. I would say 3.5 stars.",0
4.0,"I really liked that they went with detective Batman here, I also liked that it was a version of Batman we haven't seen before in the theaters. Some things didn't make sense to me, like the romance between him and Catwoman, felt very forced but this was overall a really good movie.",1
5.0,"They did a lot right with this Batman movie! Super dark, very realistic, detective focused, most combat realistic.",1
5.0,"Great film. Came to see it for the second time. Did not disappoint again. Once again, great pacing! The film goes by very smoothly, never drags on. Great for Batman films and movie goers. Great cast, cool action, drama and a true testament to the Batman character and mythos!",1
4.0,"so, so dark and psycho. No military workouts or tech gizmodry. Long dark encomiaic dirge.",1
5.0,very dark and dramatic..action packed,1
5.0,So fresh: Absolute Must see! MorbiusSweep you gotta be trolling,1
5.0,Robert Pattinson was awesome,1
5.0,The Batman was a very good movie. The plot was very good. Robert Pattinson put a different spin on the character. A darker spin for sure but he still stayed consistent to Batmans struggle both as a Victim and a as a hero. The characters where well developed and the music and sound also got high marks. The only criticism I have is the Cat Women mask its never been done like that before. so I did not care for it personally. But to be fair I'm a big Michelle Pfeiffer Cat Women fan. To me she will forever be the best Cat woman. Just my 2 cents,1
1.5,My name is Ashley A Egerton The Batman movie wasn‚Äôt that great i just saw. It tonight with my boyfriend,-1
5.0,"It was great! Acting, cast, cinematography, ZOE KRAVITZ! It was just awesome. Best Batman film I be ever seen. I‚Äôve seen ‚Äòem all.",1
4.0,"Liked: the Storyline, Bat-suit & Cinematography was quite great but the DISLIKE: the damn Bat-mobile‚Ä¶the tumbler in the last trilogy was awesome. Go see this movie!",1
5.0,"the best cinematic portrayal of batman EVER. the dark, depressing, nitty gritty street-level crime fighting is what batman needs, not any of this lame cosmic justice league nonsense.",1
4.0,"Really well done, good acting. Lots of action.",1
4.0,"Robert Pattinson is hot , I know , very brave of me to say",1
5.0,"Exciting, Action Filled, The best one yet!!!",1
5.0,fucking love it! :O),1
3.0,"Movie was mid, could‚Äôve been better ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",0
5.0,It is a bit longer than normal but I love the Batman so no complains.,1
0.5,walked out after a short time----waisted our money and time!!!!,-1
5.0,Loved the sound track and cinematography. Acting was great!,1
4.0,very interesting story line,1
5.0,The movie was really good overall but was a little long. It took a long time to get to the plot of the story line.,1
3.5,"The cinematography and all the technical aspects of the movie were very good. If you prefer acting and interplay between characters, the theatrical aspect of movies, this is perhaps not for you. But it is artistic, as in the sense of pictorial art, and that is something.",0
1.5,Movie was too long Batman was too flat to be liked.,-1
1.0,"Honestly, I fell asleep through out the movie. Extremely boring. Terrible acting/low budget.",-1
5.0,The detective Batman I've always wanted.,1
2.0,"Given this story has been told so many times, I was not expecting much. I really attended to please my son. The movie was ridiculously long and could have been finalized at many points in the movie. But it lingered on. Given its 2022, they had to use words like white privilege and equity in order to fit the liberal agenda. Feel free to watch it, it might provide you joy if you prefer things like that. Good luck.",-1
4.5,"Great detective Batman! I really enjoyed seeing that side of him and doing it with the riddler was a perfect way to showcase that part of him. I enjoyed the whole movie! Cat woman needed better motives, but I enjoyed her and Batman working together more. It‚Äôs nice to see that Batman movies have not lost their touch üëçüèæ",1
3.0,The writing for Batman was not typical. Not enough action!,0
4.0,"Movie was phenomenal, but the movie theater was full of distracting, rowdy, rude people flashing their phones and making noise. Cinemark del Norte is not a great place to watch a movie for me or my family.",1
4.0,Didn‚Äôt like that they made Bruce parents have such a dark secret,1
4.5,"We have seen so many iterations of Batman over the years, yet this one stands apart with it‚Äôs grit and dark tone. Absolutely a must see if you are a fan of Batman.",1
5.0,Immersive and engaging. I came in thinking it would be OK according to reviews. I was wrong. it's better than ok. It was excellent.,1
3.5,"We saw The Batman on Tues, April 19, 2022. I liked it! The chase scenes were amazing! However, it was slow and about an hour too long! I thought the Batman costume was outstanding! But...I really wanted to see the new Batmobile, it only showed it in shadows, never up close and sitting still! My friend who was with me gave it a 2 out of 10. He thought it was boring! Oh well, to each their own!",0
5.0,"This wasnt like the usual comic book Batman. It seemed more realistic. Batman walked among the people like a real person, which he is. The plot was brilliant and all the actors were great!!",1
4.5,Loved it. Watched it a couple times. This movie displayed the detective side of Batman. Bravo.,1
5.0,a great batman movie,1
5.0,Action packed movie filled with amazing acting.,1
5.0,loved the story and all actors were great,1
3.0,"Never any consistency with Batman. Even though the movie made alot of money I believe its because we want to see it do good. The actors are good ad well as the acting. But something's is missing. There was no Wow factor in this movie. seemed like an origin story they couldn't make up there mind with. Couldn't tell if batman had any super strength abilities or just an MMA Fighter. Was he as Psycho as the villains? Had a blade feel to it, Had a Dracula feel to it. Hunting down Villians that dont have a comic feel. Movie had no true grounding. Was confusing and long. How will this batman level up with the justice league? Batman 2?",0
4.0,Strong story line but a bit long.,1
4.0,Well it was a little too long. But we ended up really liking the movie. The characters all meshed together very well.,1
5.0,RPX! Great sound quality and screen High Definition! Super comfortable seating too! Fun times!!,1
3.5,"It's a good movie, but a little derivative of The Dark Knight trilogy.",0
5.0,Rob Pattinson was perfect. Great film noir feel. A little heavy for me at times but really great.,1
4.0,Beginning was extremely slow but as movie progressed it got interesting and exciting,1
0.5,"Horrible horrible movie!!! too long, crappy acting and too woke for my family values. It was torture I had to get up several times and walk out.",-1
4.0,Very interesting take on a classic story.,1
4.5,"It was a good movie. A little different from Christopher Nolan's films, but some very similar themes, and a lot of pauses furing the high tension moments. Very good acting, and it didn't use the same level of rage in Batman as the last trio of films. I'm excited to see what the next one will have in store for us.",1
4.0,Too long. It could have had shorter scenes that had violence but loved the story and the acting.,1
2.5,Disappointed they had to make this movie about race also. Not painful but not good either.,-1
3.0,"Good movie, dark, very similar to Phoenix as the joker movie.",0
5.0,Different than others in the franchise. Relatable,1
2.5,"The movie was okay, it was shot very dark and wasn't as much action as I anticipated.",-1
4.0,"I really loved the fight scenes, I loved how the choreography behind them and the atmosphere that the film was perfectly dark enough to fit the themes of the film. My only complaint was in the length as it felt like that the movie was trying to end itself 3 times.",1
4.0,Good Origin Storyline...A Tad Dark...The Bat needed MORE gadgets.,1
2.0,Robert Pattison is the absolute worst Batman I have ever seen. I wish I could get not only my $ back but the time viewing this movie back. Michael Keaton and Val Kilmer were MUCH better as Batman.,-1
3.0,"This movie was way too long. It had interesting plot points, but I think this would have been better explored broken into two movies. I thought Pattinson was a pretty good Batman but could have maybe been a better Bruce Wayne. I do wish Selena Kyle/Catwoman had been explored a bit more as a character. It was still ultimately an enjoyable movie, but I have enjoyed certain previous Batman movies more than this one.",0
5.0,Already got me looking forward to the next one!,1
0.5,"horrible.... just horrible. this just proves there are SUCKERS out there and if you make any BATMAN movie, they'll come running regardless how BAD it is.",-1
4.5,"great score and cinematography, literally beautiful but catwoman kinda sucked and her relationship with batman seemed a bit too forced‚Ä¶",1
0.5,"Boring, slow, and not exciting at all. I know Batman is dark but this was overboard on the darkness. Did not care for Robert Pattinson as Batman. Sorry.",-1
5.0,Just a very entertaining film. Took grandsons and we all enjoyed it.,1
0.5,Worst version of batman,-1
0.5,A terribly boring movie with cheesy dialogue. I would've rather watched Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy,-1
3.0,"I fell asleep a few times, but I think they tried to cram too many characters in at once. Not enough explosions for my taste, though, I'm a huge fan of the Christian Bale movies.",0
0.5,"Trash, waste of movie. Every scene is stretched out for no reason. Pointless movie. Dont watch it.",-1
2.0,"Unnecessarily long, became boring quite early in the film.",-1
4.5,"Great movie, but for a long movie enthusiast such as myself, this movie was too long for the purpose it was serving, and that kept it from 5 stars. If you are a fan of the original Batman Detective Comics this will more speak to your taste. Not a family film.",1
4.0,Really good. Entertaining! Just a little too long.,1
4.0,It was great movie would recommend,1
5.0,Fantastic!!!!! Batman done right,1
5.0,i liked robert that‚Äôs it,1
4.0,"I went with a group to see The Batman tonight. Pretty good movie overall, but a bit long, trying to cover too much maybe. Robert Patterson was pretty good, definitely had his moments, but Zoe Kravitz did a great job with her role as Catwoman.",1
5.0,It was very suspenseful.,1
3.5,Good movie. Bruce Wayne was too emo!,0
3.0,Cristian Bale movies were better,0
5.0,Unfortunately This movie was so GAHHHH DAMMNNN AMAZING.. MY HEART WAS RACING,1
5.0,This movie gets better every time I see it!,1
2.0,It was ok but most definitely could have been better. For me it took to long for them to figure out who the riddler was and too many people died who didn't have anything to do with the crap that was going on in his mind.,-1
3.0,Not even close to the Dark Knight. Way too long.,0
1.5,Reminiscent of Twilight‚Ä¶.lots of music to cover up Robert Pattinsons acting. A lot of fight scenes are the kind you see at Universal Studios stunt shows‚Ä¶.He also cried a lot. Just wasn‚Äôt a fan,-1
4.0,"It was good, he showed a dark side to batman.",1
5.0,This was a fun comic style batman I'm curious where they plan on taking this series too next.,1
4.0,Great plot. Good acting. Excellent cinematography. Some of the writing for the lines was subpar.,1
3.0,"Movie could have been about 20 minutes shorter. However, it was an interesting and believable take on a younger Batman and Cat Woman, it was good - just too long..",0
2.0,The movie was not good. When is DC going to learn to build a universes like Marvel,-1
4.0,"Well done as a psychological thriller, dark, and Robert Pattinson did a surprisingly fantastic job in the role. Loved the tense music throughout. Assumed audience knew some of backstory of Batman and Gotham, which was ok for me but audiences not familiar might have a lot of questions.",1
5.0,"Stands tall, shoulder to shoulder with The Dark Knight.",1
5.0,something in the way,1
5.0,it got batman so right that Christian bale just failed at,1
5.0,Riddle me this what time is a charm? Answer - The Third,1
5.0,It‚Äôs a really good movie must watch,1
5.0,Good story line and Robert Pattinson actually did a good job as Batman. Watch it!,1
5.0,"Great Movie, the Batman although somewhat a dark atmosphere is not the usual old school stuff, but I really liked the plot and the action. I'll be waiting for a sequel to this movie in the future.2 thumbs up all the way.",1
5.0,"What's to dislike? This movie is incredible and I am hoping to see a sequel. I loved the casting, the suspense, the score, the art direction, and especially the Special Fx/CGI. Great plot, script . . . and the acting was great.",1
3.5,"Definitely did not feel like 3 hours. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it. Would I watch again, no. It was entertaining",0
3.0,was slow at the beginning almost walked out,0
4.0,On edge throughout the movie,1
2.0,"Was very disappointed, again DC did not make the producers of this shameful movie stick to the original ""Batman"" story. DC needs to take clues from Stan Lee and Marvel... what a waste of 64.00 (4 tix).",-1
5.0,It was freaking awesome. Loved it.,1
4.0,Only things I didn't like were: 1. How long it took to get from point to point in the story. 2. The lighting in many scenes made it too dark to see clearly Other than those it was a pretty solid movie!,1
5.0,love it! thankful they didn't mess it up felt like you Batman movie üé•üçø,1
5.0,"This is not a typical super-hero type movie. It is a total reimagining of the Batman story, but not an origin story. The villians aren't costumed like a comic book. The environment is much more authentic/real. The movie has less action per minute than some fans may appreciate, but it has a great story with colorful/realistic characters. Excellent cast throughout.",1
4.0,"Very interesting batman, a who done it . Lots of action",1
5.0,"Great movie, dark, gritty, violent with a great love story and plot line. Well done all around by the cast, crew, director, cinematographer everyone killed it... idk about (spoiler coming) the actor playing the joker at the end tho it didnt seem very natural the laugh seemed forced and weak they should definitely change that if they move on to a Joker based sequal. Other than that I loved it Pattinson, Kravitz, Dano, Serkis, Farrell and Tuturo did a great job",1
4.5,Dark yet highly entertaining. Loved it!,1
1.5,Great movie but entirely too long! Not worth sitting through. Don‚Äôt go!,-1
4.0,Entertaining. A bit too long. 3 hrs. Longer with previews.,1
5.0,One of the best DC movies since Christopher Nolan‚Äôs Dark Knight trilogy.,1
5.0,Great storyline and overall great movie.,1
5.0,Robert Battinson is the best Batman ever! He was born to play this role!,1
1.0,it was the longest most drawn out boring movies I think I've ever watched and by far the worst Batman. I'd rather watch val Kilmer and Schwarzenegger 10 times than sit through that again.,-1
5.0,Different than the other Batman Movies but the whole mysterious story line keeps you hooked on the movie,1
5.0,Awesome! It was three hours long and I stayed awake!!!! That never happens!!!!,1
4.0,"For this to be a 3hr movie, I enjoyed it. I didnt get tired or bored with the action.",1
5.0,Really liked it! They did a really good job.,1
3.0,length was from unnecessarily stretching out scenes to make them more dramatic.,0
4.0,"I may have fell asleep at 1 point, but it happens sometimes. Really enjoyed it though.",1
4.0,"Though it was 3 hours, it didnt feel that long. Some dialogue scenes were a little too obvious, but otherwise a fun time. Didnt expect to like Pattinson, but he did well.",1
3.5,A little violent for children but otherwise good.,0
4.0,"The movie was long and always raining in so many scenes. Action was okay, just a little over dramatic.",1
5.0,"A suitably dark and moody atmosphere propels Robert Battinson through this newest take on an old motif. A slow-burn noir at its heart, moments of intense action keep the pace from dragging in spite of its approximately three hour run-time.",1
1.0,Boring. Poor character development. No plot.,-1
5.0,Great movie. Robert Pattinson did a great job.,1
5.0,What a long movie but It kept you on the edge of your seat just fantastic I didn‚Äôt think that young man would make a good Batman totally blown away thank you,1
0.5,"Wack, weak, idiotic, 3 hours just to make it long and not enjoyable. If this is the #1 detective I'm Elon musk.",-1
5.0,"The most real Batman yet, even more grounded than the Nolan trilogy. They even got the physics right! So few movies are this attentive to detail. The story is an emotional one, riddled with detective work, intrigue, and insight into both Wayne's inner world, and the corruption inside Gotham. The visual storytelling is dramatic and intense as well this is a true film noir, featuring The Batman as our central detective trying to unravel the Riddler's scheme, and he learns more than he bargained for. Also the new Batmobile is badass!",1
2.0,"this movie is violent,boring, long and drawn out. When Robert Pattinson is playing batman, he is at his best! He is vengeance after all. The supporting cast is brilliant too. Zoe Kravitz and Paul Dano are outstanding! It is a good movie, but the story was all over the place. The Dark Knight is my favorite batman movie!",-1
3.0,"The movie is really dark (not brightly colored) and the story I found to be a little hard to follow. Not the best of the best, but just an ok movie.",0
5.0,"The Batman =The BadAss! Total Thrill Ride from opening scene to Ending Scene! Smart, Brooding, Dark and Witty! What a Refreshing Reboot of a Storied Franchise! DC finally is hitting on All Cylinders! The only thing Better than the introduction of The Suicide Squad! A Must See for All fans and movie goers Around the World!",1
5.0,"I didn't think I was going to enjoy it as much as I did. I was a huge fan of the Bale Batman movies and didn't think this would hold up, but I was wrong. Very well done. Robert Pattinson surprised me. I had very low expectations when he was cast, but he proved me wrong.",1
4.0,Well made movie with good performances and a suitably dark tone. Some of the action editing seemed disconnected. A number of stunts strained credibility for a hero who is mortal.,1
0.5,The story dragged out too long. Batman was too depressing.,-1
2.0,It was boring but I‚Äôm not a Batman fan. Just watched it because I figured with Zo√´ it would be good but it was still boring.,-1
4.5,"Not that bad of movie of at all, it definitely gives a different look for Robert Pattinson but do yourself a favor and don't go in expecting it to follow the same formula as other Batman movies this one has a completely different chemistry to it.",1
4.5,Excellent and Pattinson was very good.,1
1.0,The last 30 mins are the only part I liked. Was having a hard time staying awake.,-1
3.0,Ir moved too slow and was confusing at times,0
5.0,"I hate when I can anticipate the plot moves. This left me baffled! NOT your ""typical"" action/adventure, which I'm addicted to. This is far superior than ANY previous offering of the Batman group of films! Seeing it again this weekend!",1
4.0,Dramatic. Good characters.,1
1.0,No plot ... too much violence for violence sake. Dark and depressing.,-1
5.0,Honestly the movie was exceptional. I would totally watch it over again not just with friends but also with family since it‚Äôs good. I also liked the touches of the emotional aspects and dramatic aspects. Would recommend,1
3.0,Nice cinematography but too long,0
5.0,"Movie was excellent, great plot, loved the dark twist, characters were solid, acting was solid...",1
0.5,I need a refund. Didn‚Äôt get to finish film due to fire emergency at the theater.,-1
5.0,Robert Pattinson Robert Pattinson Robert Pattinson Robert Pattinson Robert Pattinson Robert Pattinson Robert Pattinson Robert Pattinson Robert Pattinson Robert Pattinson Robert Pattinson Paul Dano Paul Dano Paul Dano Paul Dano Paul Dano Paul Dano Paul Dano Paul Dano Paul Dano Paul Dano Paul Dano,1
5.0,Exceptional movie! It couldve been a bit shorter but the plot was engaging. I look forward to seeing it again.,1
4.5,This shit was amazing,1
5.0,"Excellent movie. Different feel, but the quality of story telling, performances, as well as the overall production value were right up there with the Dark Knight. You never really feel like the movie is as long as it is which is a very good thing. I was very impressed and look forward to seeing more of this Batman in the future.",1
5.0,The Batman... a dark and gritty vision of what Gotham was like two years after Bruce Wayne became Vengence and took to the shadows to try and clean up the city. This is a key piece of info that's easy to miss. it's only been two years. BW hasn't developed the playboy persona of Bruce Wayne. He's a recluse. I loved this Batman... it was fantastically well portrayed. The scene with the Batmobile when it comes to life gave me chills. It was so good!!! Highly Recommend!,1
5.0,Good action and dialogue,1
3.0,"It was not one of the best batman movies,it was okay.",0
2.0,We didn't like the Batman movie but the service was wonderful.,-1
4.5,This was an interesting take on the Cape Crusader in the seems that it really focused on his Darknight Detective persona more so than any of the other iterations. Rob Pattison exceeded my expectations (which were admittedly low to begin with) and the overall action was edgy and more realistic. Colin Farrel was unrecognizable in his role,1
5.0,Quite possibly the best Super Hero movie to date!,1
2.0,"Too long. Some called it dark, I felt it was dreary. Not enough new material, pretty much rehash of old storylines, just with a creepy, horror story vibe. Weird, not fresh or original.",-1
4.0,A solid if unspectacular superhero film.,1
2.0,It rained a lot. For a long time. That's about it.,-1
4.0,"Much better than I expected, was very dramatic and takes you on a journey as Batman chases the riddler acrossed Gotham connecting the dots of the puzzle",1
5.0,This movie was exciting and captivating start to finish.,1
5.0,A close favorite in the Batman movies. Interested to see how this series will pan out.,1
5.0,"This isn't just a great Batman movie, it's a great mystery ) crime drama to boot.",1
5.0,"it was very dark, but I thought over all it was a really good film! it's a very far role from the shiny vampire RP is well know for playing.",1
4.0,A bit long and very dark... need more Bruce Wayne story - but not at the cost of more minutes. Decent audio in a relatively small theater. Can't wait to get this as a 4K movie in my home system.,1
5.0,a stellar modern batman,1
1.0,"Too dark, not easy to follow and poor performances",-1
4.0,"The darkness of Batman didnt fail, action scenes and storyline was great, long movie keeps you in your seat to the very end! Highly recommend seeing in the theater.",1
3.5,"3 1/2 stars but would have given a 4 1/2 star rating if they had cast a different actor in the role of Batman. Some considerations, Idris Elba, Colin Farrell, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt , Hugh Jackman. I don't know if anyone would agree on any of these Actors that they would be the one either. There are some big shoes to fill.",0
5.0,"A very different but perfectly valid presentation of The Batman. It has a good plot that takes the viewer along to discover the story. The visuals were well done. Lighting-wise, this is the darkest movie I've even seen without any bright scenes in the entire movie. It was good to see it in a theater instead of at home.",1
2.5,Too long. Robert Patterson played his role well but not anything exceptional. Others have done a better job.,-1
4.0,really good adaptation of the the long Halloween,1
4.0,"It was somewhat dark, different from other Batman movies.",1
1.0,Robert Pattinson comes across as an emo shrimp in the role of Batman.,-1
5.0,"This was a dark, gritty movie--as it should be! It takes place in Gotham City, a place where the sun never shines. This is early Batman--one who isn't quite sure who he is or what he should be and Pattinson portrayed it PERFECTLY. I absolutely loved the way they showed Batman before he got his stuff together. A new Batman, one without years of experience--only a passion for doing what is right. This movie is the Batman I want to see continued. Forget the others, let's see where Battinson goes...",1
3.0,Good fighting scenes when there was. Was a very slow burn movie. Could have had more action less filler.,0
4.0,It was a good movie with lots of plots interacting into one movie.,1
4.0,A very good adaptation of the Batman and other key characters of Gotham City.,1
5.0,"Kept us on the edge of our seat, from start to finish!",1
5.0,that it had one little moment with the joker!!,1
5.0,"Lots of action, great characters and you didnt want it to end",1
5.0,I have been a Batman fan for years and ket me tell you... THIS IS HOW YOU WRITE A BATMAN MOVIE!!!!! He is first and foremost a detective. This Batman is still new to crime fighting and flawed. His relationship with Gordon was right out if the comic books. I love the new direction they took Catwoman. Truly one of my favorite Batman films. I think it is just as good as The Dark Knight (2008).,1
0.5,That was 3 hours of my life I‚Äôll never get back. Worst. Movie. Ever.,-1
5.0,"Great plot, action, acting and special effects!",1
5.0,This movie is tough also i love catwoman.,1
5.0,Best set decoration and effects,1
5.0,Movie was a bit long but it was worth the time watching. Good plot for future films and character building. The Catwoman and Batman duo was pretty cool too.,1
5.0,can't wait for the next one,1
3.5,"Great cinematography and action, just lacked a succinct storyline.",0
5.0,I liked how the movie had so many different things throw at the viewers. Totally recommended.,1
3.0,"I'm giving three stars only because of Cat Woman. If Cat Woman wasn't in this movie, then this movie would suck. This movie DRAGS and we barely get any action.",0
3.0,Boring and picture was too dark,0
2.0,"It was okay, felt like I was about to fall asleep at times. Robert Pattinson couldn‚Äôt land a smash through a window to save his life. His voice barely changed from Bruce Wayne to Batman, and the eye makeup under his mask was an interesting choice. Everyone else did a great job. There wasn‚Äôt much action with his gadgets either but I guess he is going ‚Äúbroke‚Äù in it so maybe that‚Äôs why.",-1
3.0,"Not a bad movie, probably the darkest Batman yet. It seemed to drag on going nowhere sometimes but still held my interest",0
3.0,Good acting and chemistry re: Robert P and Zoe K. Movie as a whole was ho hum. Constant rain and dreariness a bit much.,0
3.0,It was okay. The Catwoman was the highlight of the movie.,0
5.0,The movie was awesome! The entire cast did a excellent job! Very Dark and very suspenseful! I can‚Äôt wait for the next one!,1
0.5,Slow could not follow way too long. They should‚Äôve got a better person to play Batman. Penguin character was stupid the Riddler character was stupid all the characters were stupid. I would not recommend ever,-1
5.0,I liked the movie. It was a unique way to do Batman that I thought was nifty.,1
2.5,Movie was ok. Not bad. Not great. Movie was ok.,-1
5.0,Best Batman movie so far. Great casting and cinematography. Definitely the most realistic and believable plot. Those expecting this to be an action packed superhero movie will be disappointed.,1
5.0,This was the best most fun movie I've seen in years. It was close to 3 hours long but it was so intense and exciting that the time flew by. I hope there will be another installment of this soon.,1
3.5,Entertaining but a little long.,0
1.0,Worse Batman movie out of all the Batman franchise movies. Out of 3hrs only 20 minutes of action. Thumbs down all around.,-1
5.0,The acting was great. I always enjoy the dark cinematic vibe of the Batman movies! Excellent writing.,1
3.5,"A lot of great action, but too long!",0
2.0,"This batman is purely for looks. Lacks anything that would make me interested to see it again or see the inevitable sequels that will follow. Fight scenes were the only highlight for an otherwise strenuous 3hr viewing. Mediocre batman, even worse Bruce wayne.",-1
1.5,"Couldn't hear dialogue, movie was too long, Robert Pattinson was a bore, Zoe Kravitz was a less sexy Halle Berry reboot.",-1
5.0,Amazing!!! Can‚Äôt wait to watch it again!,1
5.0,"I love that there was a lot of action, but there was SOOOOO much suspense! People forget that Batman is a DETECTIVE. There are many great Batnan films, but this one just may be my favorite. That's just me, though.",1
2.0,"very boring, lack of creativity zero technology",-1
5.0,It was a good movie but like some movies there were some slow parts,1
5.0,Loved the action all the way through!!!!,1
3.5,"The movie was good overall, I won't buy the DVD to re watch it but it was worth the money once",0
5.0,It was really good!!!ü•∞üòç,1
5.0,Absolutely amazing!! Must watch movie!!,1
5.0,3 hours but it kept your attention! Great movie cant wait for the next one!!,1
2.0,Unnecessarily long and boring at times.,-1
0.5,It‚Äôs not worth the hype it‚Äôs really boring not a lot of action a lot of trying to find the riddler it‚Äôs boring,-1
0.5,"The movie had too much talking and hardly no action sequences, the picture was too dark couldnt hardly see anything",-1
1.0,The actors did a great job but the movie was so slow I almost fell asleep. I dont mean to sound mean. I love these kinds of films. Just found it boring.,-1
5.0,Dark as usual but tells a great story,1
5.0,One of the best It was so good that you didnt know it was 3 hours long,1
3.5,the movie was dark and unlike the Batman I used to know.,0
2.5,I‚Äôll never get those three hours back.,-1
2.5,"It was ok, a little too long but the acting was good",-1
4.5,lots of suspense and action,1
3.5,"Great special effects! The story moves very well and it was fun for my husband and I. The new Batman suit was awesome. He was also a grittier batman. The new take on the Bat Mobile was so cool. I enjoy the incorporation of modern technology, so the movie felt current. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because my husband felt it was overly dramatic at times. I liked the dramatic moments though.",0
5.0,"LOVE LOVE this version of Batman. Can‚Äôt wait for the next one. Was unsure of Pattinson as Batman, but he won my heart! Must see!",1
3.0,"liked the darker side and a bit more on him being a detective, cinematography was good and direction, but the story and the pacing were the weak points with the undertones that were heavy handed and not subtle. good film overall but probably wouldn't hype it up or tell people they should watch it.",0
5.0,Amazing story and cinematography great movie in all,1
3.0,"Batman wasn't really batman. He just walked into buildings, never hid in the shadows. Just throwing himself into a fight not trying to take people out quietly. And Robert Patterson just isn't Batman. Batmobile was cool of courae",0
0.5,"The film was shot entirely too dark, very hard to see many of the scenes. 3 hours was entirely too long, felt they tried to fill the movie with too many characters everyone knows.",-1
4.0,To expensive for a fantasy movie,1
4.0,"Great story and didn‚Äôt rehash the intro story that‚Äôs been done so many times already. I just wish the fellow playing Batman had a little more energy when he spoke and walked. The slow walk and mumbling mixed with the bummer theme song were enough to put everyone to sleep, luckily the story, catwoman and penguin are incredible in it. See it",1
2.0,Way too dark and depressing. Not at all what I had hoped for or expected. Not worth 3 hours of your life!,-1
4.0,"Good story line, action and actors. A little long",1
5.0,The Batman was amazing. Felt like a very genuine storyline with believable backstories for the main villain. Beautiful cinematography and well scored. There needs to be a sequel.,1
3.0,"Slow , long, long. & just ok",0
5.0,Great movie! Closest to the classic Batman cartoons. Dark vibes love it,1
4.5,better the second time. pacing was Batman like so I suppose what was expected. but sometimes maybe watching Batman doesn't have to feel like swimming through a morphine haze.,1
5.0,Im in Love with all Batman movies,1
4.5,this happened to my buddy once,1
5.0,The Batman was good. Good story line and action.,1
2.5,It is very long and very dark. Batman was sullen. There was no happiness or optimism in the whole movie. Not sure it was worth the almost 20 it cost for our tickets.,-1
0.5,Horrible. Wanted to walk out.,-1
5.0,the movie was great!!! I didn't gonin there have high expectations but it surpassed them all together.,1
5.0,It's a fresh new take on The Batman. Very well executed. The cinematography was the best I've seen recently. Bravo.,1
5.0,amazingly done. didn't feel like 3 hrs at all.,1
5.0,Loved it. Pattinson can be my Batman any day.,1
2.0,Horrible acting. Super cheesy scenes. Not worth the 3 hours.,-1
5.0,It was excellent. Maybe the best Batman movie yet!,1
2.0,"Warning. The most EMO Batman I have ever experienced. First he really is very small physically. Not very imposing., hard to buy him as a bad ass he looks like he weights 150 pounds. The greasy hair and gross clothes. NOT Bruce Wayne at all. I know he is supposed to be dark and brooding but OMG! I think I will call him Prozac Batman. Terrible job by RP. I need Christian Bale or Ben Affleck or even M Keaton.",-1
5.0,One of the best movies I‚Äôve seen so far. Love the soundtrack !!!!,1
5.0,It was a great movie! Loved it!,1
2.0,"Long movie, slow and boring story line. Not much action.",-1
5.0,The sound effects and the acting,1
3.5,"A little long and Slow at times, but worth seeing .",0
5.0,Everything was amazing and awesome,1
5.0,"Amazing cinematography, great acting and writing. Music, costume, casting on point.",1
1.5,It dragged on and the story line was so hard to follow and it jumped around like crazy! There were 9 of us and we were all disappointed!,-1
5.0,was pretty good and I'm more of a marvel fan than anything but that was good,1
3.5,"Better and more engrossing than I expected. A bit slow from time to time, and unending rainy nights.",0
5.0,OMG THE CATWOMAN IS SO HOT,1
3.0,Great actors but another drawn out DC comics movie.,0
4.0,Plot too complicated.,1
5.0,It is an action packed movie. It kept me on the edge of my seat all through the movie. I highly recommend the movie.,1
5.0,"Fantastic Movie! DC needs to keep pushing with movies of this caliber. Please don't kill this off, make a sequel with this version.",1
1.0,The whole movie was terrible walked out in 30 min. Why is the vampire werewolf boy playing batMAN,-1
5.0,This movie is more realistic (if realistic is possible with a Batman movie) than other over the top Batman movies. Plot doesnt hinge on never seen before gadgets or vehicles. Kind of a working mans Batman if you will. A bit long but it answers all the questions it poses so youre only left hanging at the very end in the set up for the next installment.,1
3.0,The movie was just ‚Äúokay‚Äù to me. Robert Patterson does not scream BATMAN to me. I felt the movie tried to top the others and did not do that.,0
4.5,Really good. Being PG-13 kept it back.,1
4.0,"beautiful unique shots throughout the film, interesting update for the riddler, very forced/unnatural romantic subplot, the middle third drags with a good complex finale. interesting use of daddy Wayne lore, the gadgets were very commonplace.",1
1.0,"Too damn long. That was the only ""comic book"" movie that I chose to see, based on the previous Batman movies. It was so boring, that I fell asleep during the movie. No more ""comic book"" movies, no more cartoon movies, no more ""bang & crash"" movies. Only ""quality cinema."" And I realize that I probably will not be seeing too many more movies, but that is the price I will have to pay for trying to keep trash & stupidity out of my time & life.",-1
1.5,Movie was Bad. Too long. Some serious editing could have improved it immensely. Penguin chase scene was way too long. Broody Batman did not fly with me.,-1
3.0,"The riddler was good, but Robert Pattinson does not live up to his predecessor, Christian bale.",0
5.0,Honestly great movie,1
0.5,Didnt even watch the movie someone took our seats so we sat In front of them and they were coughing so we had to leave 30 minutes In,-1
4.5,Let‚Äôs see if Fraser can get a back to back cinematography Win.,1
3.0,"Movie was really great!!! My son and I enjoyed. Colin Farrell was not even on my radar!! He played his part well. IM still trying to process Robert Pattinson as Batman. He didn't have the swag that other actors had as Bruce Wayne...other than that still a great movie...I loved Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman, but why she just wore a black Skully as a mask? I dunno...",0
5.0,why did the shotgun hurt him?,1
4.0,This one was very well done. It was dark and twisted and showed that vengeance only begets more vengeance. I'm surprised how much I enjoyed the acting considering who was in it but it really was good acting! The atmosphere was dark and creepy. It was very good overall!,1
5.0,"Absolutely entertaining. Robert Pattinson does fantastic work as Bruce Wayne/The Batman, showcasing a gritty and extraordinary presence as one of DC's greatest heroes in comic book history. Also, the supporting cast has great chemistry that works well alongside the titular character of the film.",1
4.0,Great storyline and characters. Very long. No look into Bruce Wayne‚Äôs life‚Ä¶only Batman/Vengeance.,1
5.0,"Fresh, visually fascinating, worth the length. The action was so crisp, the lighting was mesmerizing. There was always something going on and even the slow parts weren't boring. Could watch it over and over again.",1
4.0,a bit dark in Gotham City - night always and rain. Otherwise good,1
5.0,"This is my third time seeing it and I absolutely love it, even still! Top notch acting and a LOT of TLC went into making this. Its very faithful to the comics, so hardcore fans will deem it worth sitting for three hours!",1
2.0,To dark picture. Weak story line,-1
5.0,"I loved this movie. The pacing was good and the cinematography was beautiful. I love Batman and how in the end he realizes that he needs to be more, be a symbol of hope, and bring a change to Gotham. I love Catwoman and how she realizes that she is not the only one who is an orphan and that Batman has her back. The Riddler was a really fascinating, creepy, and a genius character. It was a shock to me that he flooded Gotham with the help of Batman. Batman helped him by solving his riddles, and getting clues to where the Riddler might be. I love everything about this movie, and I would love to see this movie for a 2nd time. This is a movie I will never forget!",1
5.0,Fabulous. Rob Pattinson perfect as Batman. Zoe Kravitz also awesome. one of the best chase & crash sequences ever. Truly dark & sinister. High tension greatness.,1
5.0,10/10 must recommend,1
5.0,"If anyone loved the TV Show Gotham you will very much relate to the characters of this movie! Even though the lighting could have been brighter, the darkness and grey tones of the movie define how evil the gangs and drug lords of this city are.",1
2.0,Not impressed! 3 hours wasted! Never checked my watch that often.,-1
5.0,Definite must see!! Bust modern Batman movie made in the last 20 years!!!,1
4.5,I would say it's up there with Dark Knight and Patterson did a great job. They really nailed the Riddler. Some of the language is a little raunchy but then again it's darker themed so I'm not surprised.,1
5.0,Great job by DC and the actors! Dark and gritty but also kept you interested. Can‚Äôt wait for the follow-up!,1
5.0,Robert Pattenson made a good batman. I like how they changed Bruce Wayne's storyline.,1
5.0,Good movie a lot of detail with his family,1
5.0,Great Movie! Great acting and in deep meaning for the characters and there deep motives. Would definitely recommend.,1
3.5,Different pov of Batman but I enjoyed it.,0
4.5,The only thing I didn't like about it was how long this movie was. With that being said the movie was really well paced and kept me entertained for the 3 hour run time.,1
1.0,What the hell was that he kept getting beat up and falling asleep‚Ä¶ ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,-1
3.0,it started off slow kinda feel a sleep but the ending was good.,0
1.0,Too dark and too long!,-1
4.0,I thought it was good. Not as good as Christian Bale's batman.,1
4.0,"This was an interesting and little refreshing version of Batman. It was slightly Batman meets Sin City a bit. I came into the theatre with an open mind and also knew it was a slightly long running too. So with eyes wide open I saw a very well acted Batman/Bruce Wayne with a very interesting Catwoman. Jeffrey Wright is great in almost all he does and he also doesn't disappoint. I give it a 4 out of 5 as there could have been a little more humor in the film in my humble opinion. Overall, loved it. I was glad to not see gratuitous violence. Loved how the new batmobile was introduced! Colin Farrell is also outstanding alongside John Tuturro as the bad guys. Great move - would watch again. Great cinematography too!",1
4.0,"Some of it was maybe not child appropriate, with some curse words not for younger viewer but other than that it was a must see!",1
5.0,"Second best batman I‚Äôve ever seen. It‚Äôs not just another h√©roe movie, it‚Äôs an actual suspense, detective story. Best portrayal of the best detective. It gave me vibes from the old WB animated series.",1
5.0,Took the whole family. Love that it was unique and can stand on its own. My husband loved it the most. Will probably have to see it several more times.,1
3.0,Dark and so so long. I did not hate it but did not love it.,0
4.0,Very dark and I wouldnt recommend for young kids but it was very good! A little slow to develop and Ill need to watch it again to pick up on some things I may have missed the first time around but its definitely worth seeing.,1
4.5,Loved so much action great plot twist,1
5.0,"This was, by far, the most captivating Batman to be shared with us by Mr. Pattinson, what a cinematic masterpiece, this has made me fall deeply in love with superhero movies all over again ‚ù§Ô∏è",1
5.0,The movie was excellent. The actors were excellent. The plot was excellent. Its been a very long time since i have seen a movie that takes its time to build the characters. They missed nothing. There was enough fighting and suspense to hold the attention of the intelligent movie watcher. Its not the typical Batman.,1
5.0,"Loved the new direction they took with this Batman. As a huge fan of Christopher Nolans Batman, this rendition of the dark knight did not disappoint.",1
5.0,Great movie. action packed and thrilling.,1
1.0,I didn't get to see the movie do to a complication,-1
5.0,Great story and action,1
3.5,Robert Pattinson was ok. The movie was a bit drawn out.,0
5.0,Awesome movie Im so happy I finally saw it.,1
4.0,great movie! would have been a 5 star if it wasnt so long.,1
5.0,Me and my girlfriend had a good time it‚Äôs a good movie,1
2.0,Just wasnt as good as other movies of batman,-1
0.5,"Emo looking Batman, SLOW!!! First half I was sleepy, second half just pissed that I was wasting my time on this movie! WORST Batman EVER! (And I‚Äôve seen all since Adam West)",-1
2.0,"Not original story re: parents too many extra characters. Very, very long movie. I lost interest after awhile. Make a movie with Catwoman she was good!",-1
4.5,Very different kind of Batman movie. Robert Pattinson was excellent as both Batman and Bruce Wayne. The Riddler was so diabolical and Cat woman was Batmans love interestsort of. All in all a very good movie.,1
3.0,"Hmmm, Im not sure about this one ? The storyline is all over the place ? And back round was way too LOUD! could barely hear the characters. I kind of expected a better story line .",0
5.0,"This is how a Batman movie should be done, perfectly balanced, showcasing his detective and combat skills.",1
2.0,"Too long, could have been an hour shorter. Not the worst Batman, but not the best.",-1
0.5,"Silly use of multiple injuries. The Mayor that Shot, being completely blow off her feet, then took shrapnel while being pulled away. Then she was caught in a flood & washed downstream with tons of building pieces in the water, finally being pushed ashore and covered with steel. After all that, at the end, she is quick walking through chest deep water!! Even Batman wasnt anywhere near that resilient.",-1
4.5,It was AMAZING!!!! Watched it three times!! Some of the dialogue is a little cringy but it was almost perfect,1
5.0,I don't normally like batman movies but I actually liked this one,1
3.5,"I FORGOT MY COMMENTS. IT'S TO LATE TO DOWN GRADE MY RATING TO A 3.5-RATING. WHY: FROM MY THEOLOGICAL, MORAL & ETHICAL PROSPECTIVE 1. SEEMS TO PARRALEL ""SUPERHUMANS AND SUPERHEROES"" AS ICONIC FIGURES TO GOD AND MY SAVIOR-JESUS CHRIST, IN THIS WORLD. THAT WITHOUT GOD, WE CAN FIND OUR OWN WAY-SALVATION & STRENGTH INDIVIDUALLY & COLLECTIVELY FULLY TRUSTING SELF OR EACH OTHER, IN HANDLING THE SPIRITUAL, MORAL, ETHICAL & EMOTIONAL OF GOOD VS EVIL. 2. I DO APPRECIATE BATMAN COMING TO HIS SENSES, THAT REVENGE IS NOT THE WAY TO LOVE, HOPE, HEALING, FORGIVENESS, PEACE & SALVATION. 3. THE EVIL-SPIRIT OF REVENGE PROFOUNDLY REMINDS US OF PAST HISTORY OF AFFLICTED HURT-PAIN AND UNJUSTIFIABLE SUFFERING ON SELF, A LOVE-ONE, FRIENDS AND/OR THE WORLD. YOU ARE EMOTIONALLY, MORALLY AND SPIRITUALLY DECEIVED, TO JUSTIFY YOUR SELF-RIGHTEOUS NESS, INWHICH, THE INNER SPIRIT OF RAGE AND BITTERNESS BECOMES A MORAL GOOD OF ACTION. 4. I'M DEEPLY GRATEFUL THAT YOUR ENDING SCRIPE ON REVENGE, LET'S THE WORLD KNOW AND THOSE WHO NOT ONLY HAVE MORAL, EMOTIONAL & SPIRITUAL PROBLEMS, WITH UNJUSTIFIABLE AFFLICTED PAIN & SUFFERING UPON THEM, TO SEEK PROFESSIONAL AND PROFOUND SPIRITUAL HELP, BUT NOT THROUGH REVENGEFUL SELF-RIGHTEOUS MEANS. 5. I ONLY WISH THAT A (800), AND/OR SOME ONE ANNOUNCE, AT THE END OF THE MOVIE, TO HELP PEOPLE AND LOVE ONES WHO SEEK REVENGE, HAVE RAGING ANGER, AND BITTERNESS COPING PROBLEMS, GET HELP...",0
5.0,Loved the noir aspects of the film and that score and soundtrack overall was absolutely incredible,1
3.0,Bad acting. The riddler didnt fit. Just not a good Batman movie. At least Gordon didnt disappoint.,0
5.0,Best live action Batman Ive ever seen,1
5.0,I loved the acting and the story line,1
3.0,Not a huge fan of plot or how they story played out.,0
5.0,I hate saying 5 stars but IT WAS!! I notoriously fall asleep in theater but this was beginning to end action and excitement,1
5.0,Definitely love the Darkness!!,1
5.0,"Fantastic movie! I really liked Batman being the investigative detective, along with all of the exciting action sequences! My kids really enjoyed it!",1
4.0,This movie starts a bit slow. But is a masterpiece and truly breaks the psychological side of Batman. The Riddler is extremely calculated and menacing in this film. I love every bit of this movie. It‚Äôs a must watch and leaves you wondering what‚Äôs next.,1
0.5,"Extremng BOOORING,..1 hour of boredom in and only 8 minutes of excitement then boring til the 2 hour mark and another exciting part then more boredom. Only the last 30 minutes was kind of exciting. TOO much boring dialog, extended boring scenes that should've been cut short. Save you're money and wait til it's on a streaming service.",-1
5.0,"What does a liar do when dead? He lies still. Something that‚Äôs going to keep you drawn from beginning to end. From a dark story, wonderful performances and a brilliant pace, The Batman by far is among the best films of the year.",1
4.5,It‚Äôs a more dark and psychological Batman. A good change from overdone movies.,1
5.0,Excellent action movie. Lots of good special effects and many twists of plot lines. I would see it again. It doesn't hurt that the Batman is Rob Pattinson and therefore easy on the eyes.,1
5.0,this movie was refreshing and powerful. I loved getting to see Batman so grounded in each scene.,1
4.0,"The visual appeal of this movie is off the chart. It oozes mood. Every frame is rich with a mixture of filth and beauty. the score is one of the most enthralling that I've heard in a long time. While the story got lost in its own details a little bit, it is an engrossing detective story. Ultimately this movie is a little weird and a few beats feel off, but somehow it pulls off a thrilling experience from a series that I suspected was dead.",1
5.0,Love this version of Batman...non stop action and the storyline is phenomenal,1
5.0,Great storyline & actors were exceptional,1
3.0,The movie was a bit too long. It could have used some small bit of humor or a light spot to give some contrast in the never ending darkness.,0
0.5,The longest stupidest Batman ever made period.,-1
4.0,"Just too many dark scenes, otherwise would see BATMAN again.",1
4.0,It was ok but nothing extraordinary.,1
2.0,"I liked our seating. Did not enjoy the actual movie Supporting characters horrible acting, not enough action and fight scenes, too many long dialogues, picture quality very poor too long and too boringly dramatic at the wrong times. Special effects werent captivating at all",-1

5.0,the most handsome Batman! I liked everything of this movie.,1
2.0,He was the worst one yet. This movie felt every bit of the 3hr run time.,-1

5.0,"all of it. but always dark or cloudy, little too much. even for batman",1
5.0,One of the best Batman movies! It was a nice change of pace from the typical Batman movies. I loved the fight scenes too!,1
4.0,"Exciting well written movie, kept my interest for the three hour run.",1
4.0,Movie was better then we expected. We enjoyed a theme through the movie. Good to see a movie we enjoy from start to finish,1
1.5,Very dark and too long. Odd emphasis on the various sound effects. Ear bloodening car sounds and some mumbled dialogues. It appears to rain in every scene....writer-director takes the weather/mood class a little too far. There wasn't a real wrap-up to the storyline and any teaser for future sequels unless I missed it I would just wait to stream it.,-1
4.0,Robert Pattinson did a GREAT job as Batman!! He was the only part of the movie I loved. The rest was good but he definitely stood out for me.,1
5.0,They took Batman to his roots. The detective!!! Awesome film.,1
5.0,If your a Batman fan you will love this movie it‚Äôs the darker comic version of Batman that everyone has always wanted. Robert Pattinson does a great job with his version of the character and in many ways I like this version better than even the dark night trilogy. Definitely recommend.,1
5.0,"I loved the dark, brooding, aggressive version of The Batman! The worlds greatest detective returns to the big screen in all his fight in the shadows glory, afte that Ben affleck disaster. The story was developed well and went in a believable direction. I loved it!",1
4.5,"Overall terrific movie because the book (the ""story) was really good. Very dark which I liked. The cinematography was incredible. My only compliant is that it was too violent for my taste.",1
4.0,"I didn't think vamp sparkle could pull it off but ... he did. but 3 hours??!!! It was worth the price of the movie ticket though, enjoyed it.",1
1.0,Over all very disappointed !!! Casting team did a very bad job !! Batman look like Drug addict !!! And poor choose of a actor for Alfreds role . Alfred should be play by someone have very heavy British accent !! First 60 minutes of the movie so Boring !!!!,-1
5.0,It is a must see if you are a batman fan!!!!,1
5.0,I liked the dark more realistic Batman in this movie the most .,1
2.0,"Unbalanced editing, some great set pieces, but more comedy than actual intrigue.",-1
4.0,a good movie that makes you want more. that is the issue I had because it felt unfinished. maybe that was the set up for sequels.,1
0.5,"it dragged on omg. It felt longer than Endgame (incl. end scene). There were too many drawn out scenes, that at some point I started watching YT vids DURING the movie.",-1
5.0,It‚Äôs the best acting I‚Äôve seen in a Batman movie in a long time.,1

5.0,"Great movies, I liked all the scenes with Batman in it.",1
5.0,"Pretty good movie, it‚Äôs one big mystery/puzzle",1
1.0,We caught the matinee show. All storylines and no action. My date and I fell asleep multiple times throughout the movie. Like seriously 3 hours of my life wasted. We shouldve stayed in bed. More action going on there anyway.,-1
2.0,"Ummmm it was very long with nothing happening. Batman looked good but otherwise, all the acting was just ok, storyline was boring and not very well casted.",-1
5.0,I loved the action sequences,1
5.0,"Enjoyed movie, loved last riddle",1
5.0,a throw back to the original series,1
1.5,Too long. Too much dialog. Too much foul language. I know that there is a dark side to batman but seems like most of the scenes were in the dark,-1
5.0,Best Batman movie ever,1
5.0,Its was great movie!,1
4.0,Long movie but allowed for more depth and character development.,1
4.0,Non stop action! Great new twist on Batman story,1
4.5,I loved the whole movie!! Robert Patterson is the best Batman!!,1
4.0,Different view of Bruce Wayne and the dynamic between Batman the police and the city. Darker version of the iconic character,1
3.0,The background was either shades of black or gray. It was difficult to see the characters. Lighten up the screen background. There's got to be more creative ways to show darkness or evil. Try birightness. Evil always looks cheerful int he beginning. The film quality reeked of cheapness.,0
4.0,"Too long, a little too dark.",1
5.0,"If there really was someone tough enough to be a superhero this is how it would look. Makes the whole thing somewhat more believable, for those of us who struggle through many superhero movies these days.",1
5.0,Throughly enjoyed this iteration of Batman. You can only tell the same story so many times and I thought this was very well done. Robert Pattinson was a pleasant surprise. Really like what he brought to the role.,1
4.5,Good I was just looking for more special effects,1
4.5,Robert Pattinson did superb as the Batman Loved it! All three hours!,1
4.5,Outstanding and prob by fave Batman movie to date. I've seen them all.,1
4.0,Fun movie. Good story and great music,1
5.0,This movie was amazing! The pace was perfect and such a great rendition of the Batman! I can only hope the cast can stay together long enough for 3 movies.,1
1.0,possible the WORSE batman movie in history.,-1
5.0,I didn‚Äôt like cause mine and my husband sit did not heat and we was cold the whole time,1
2.0,"The first hour was dreadfully slow, didn't make musch sense. I fact, overall the plot unfilded very very slowly, and wasn't worth waiting for. I almost walked out. but Tuturroo was delightfully menacing evil, Jeffrey Wright, Colin Farrell and Zoe Kravitz all played their parts really well, the parts just weren't that interesting. Paul Dano was believably insane. But basically it was eye candy and bits and pieces of good stuff. It was probably over an hour too lonmg.",-1
5.0,"Dark movie, very good script.",1
4.0,Totally did not have any good expectations about this film and I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected! Lots of little things in the film that made this take on the Dark Knight a truly fresh take. I heartily recommend this film.,1
5.0,Good movie but a bit long.,1
3.0,Way too long and didn't require cat woman,0
2.5,Good story line- but boring -,-1
5.0,"This is a great movie. The story was believable, with occasional over the top Batmanesque style schemes. Acting was better than expected. Would watch again at home. Worth $20 and 3 hours. üëçüèª",1
1.0,Worst Batman made. The Shallow dialogue along with undeveloped characters made it Poor quality & the Scenes were so lengthy. It was too dismal with little enticement left for imagination. Not to mention the 30 minutes of obnoxious previews. The delicious popcorn was the only thing that made it worthwhile.,-1
5.0,i liked the new batman. i liked the story line. i liked the actors portraying the characters,1
1.0,"Garbage movie. Bad acting by Patinson in the extreme, no discernible plot, scenes with zero speaking that last waaaaay to long and no chemistry between the cast, especially between Kravits and Patinson. As for the theme of Batman, this was a weak, afraid wimp in a costume who had rage fits where ue was worse than the bad guys. To summarize: garbage.",-1
5.0,"It‚Äôs a great movie it gave me a real life feel , Towards the end Batman became a Hero to the people",1
1.0,"First of all, the movie has very little lighting. You have to lean foreward to try and see anything. Its a dark movie, I get it, but Bruce Wayne seems to never wash his hair, is constantly depressed and everyone speaks in low tones. There's absolutely no happiness or joy in any scene, and the music plays the sames notes relentlessly. Is it possible to make a movie TOO dark? I think they've succeeded.",-1
4.5,Finally felt like a real Batman movie.,1
5.0,"The movie kept you intrigued with the question of who is the Riddler. It was a little slow moving but thats the theme of Batman, mysterious and dark. I love Batman so I was not disappointed. Robert Patterson did an excellent, excellent job. His my favorite now.",1
5.0,"Was a little long, but was interesting and never felt long, or boring. Good script, decent acting. Good take on the Batman story.",1

5.0,I really enjoyed it!,1
5.0,Super good. Loved the story plot.,1
4.0,needs more zoe kravitz.,1
4.0,Started off really slow. A really dark partial of the character. A really cool version of the batt mobile. The movie is three hours long,1
5.0,Great camera work and vision a different but thought out Batman movie,1
5.0,"I loved the action and the mystery, I believe Pattinson is a great fit for Batman cant wait to see more.",1
5.0,One of my favorite moviesss!!!,1

5.0,Great plot but too long,1
5.0,Action packed thriller!!!!,1
1.5,"Actor sucks, too much liberal politics and fake DC punishments for criminals.",-1
4.5,It was slow to begin but we liked the tie-in with the characters. It was a bit long.,1
5.0,I love the detective style of Batman,1
5.0,It‚Äôs basically Batman investigating the zodiac killer in the movie ‚Äúseven.‚Äù It‚Äôs brilliant.,1
5.0,"Great parallels and better backstory. What was great is that this Batman was realistic with the gadgets, combat and stunts.",1
2.5,Too Long to get to the point.,-1
5.0,MUST SEE ABSOLUTELY THRILLING,1
4.0,Solid move. Just a little long.,1

4.5,Action packed with great plot and actors...... kept my interest.,1
5.0,Great Movie Highly recommend!,1
5.0,Well paced and built on the recent BATMAN movies themes and character development. Surprisingly refreshing and cathartic. Will recommend to all of my friends.,1
5.0,"Entertaining, thoroughly enjoyed it",1
1.0,Boring. I think worst Batman I‚Äôve seen.,-1
5.0,"As a Batman fan since the 80s, this take on the series was raw, dark, and gritty. The music, sound effects, visuals, the Gotham underworld, villains, the batsuit/batmobile/batcave, all done up so amazing! Loved it and cant wait to see what comes next in this series. Definitely a Batman film for adults with a complete story and keeps you guessing ?",1
1.0,"Entirely too long for no reason. Relationship between batman and catwoman was undeveloped, unneccesary, and unbelievable. Driving scene was absurdly long. What was the purpose of this movie? What did it offer that none of the other batman movies offered? Riddles were guessed absurdly and unbelievably instantaneously. I can go on and on. If it was 2h long, I wouldn't be as offended at how awful it was but there were so many inneccesarily long scenes that brought nothing to the movie.",-1
4.0,"I had to leave because I was just to exhausted I have a newborn and I don‚Äôt get enough rest but the movie was awesome!!! 4 stars because I‚Äôm privet to the original Michael Keaton jack, Kim, and the original Alfred!! But this Alfred was the next best to fill his shoes! Great movie a must see!!!!",1
5.0,"Terrific movie. A lot of action, clues and a great plot.",1
5.0,Loved it. Really really long. But loved it. Honored more of the comic book side to an extent. But also wanna see something like the DCEU.,1
1.0,Too dark. Creepy. Inappropriate. Should be rated R.,-1
5.0,I wasnt certain if Robert Pattinson had the depth of character to be able to play this role. But I was wrong. He was awesome!,1
1.0,"The move was way too dramatic, and Batman looked too serious the whole time, not saying much in between. Some areas of the movie were okay like the penguin scenes. But everything else I think could have been done a bit different. After watching this (more action needed), I don‚Äôt see much interest in the next chapter. Not trying to downplay the franchise, but disappointed compared to the last Batman - dark knight rises",-1
5.0,Everything was great!,1
5.0,The point is I didn't give this movie a shot and it surprised me,1
5.0,it's was a very good movie.,1

5.0,"Acting, Directing, and Scenery was amazing 10/10 Movie!",1
3.5,"Definitely a long movie (3hrs). As a huge Batman fan, I thought the story was a bit long. The characters were ok not great.",0
3.0,Dont think he was best Batman.,0
5.0,A fantastic crime story with a zodiac killer theme. You‚Äôve never seen Batman like this. Personally think The Batman beat out The Dark Knight,1
5.0,"Really good action movie. The whole cast was great and even though it was almost 3 hours the story kept me engaged and was not bored, story moved along really well. This was our first visit to a theater since the start of the pandemic and very happy we chose The Batman for our first outing!",1
5.0,An excellent Batman film. Loved it. RP is a very convincing Bruce Wayne and Batman. Must go see!,1
5.0,The Seven of Batman movies. in some places it even acts/feels like the other Fincher film Fight Club. Solid.,1
5.0,Movie was great better then expected.,1
0.5,This is honestly THE worst Batman movie I‚Äôve EVER seen!,-1
3.0,Not as good as I though it would be. Too much talking and not enough ass kicking!,0
2.5,It was boring with action if you know what I mean,-1
4.0,Surprisingly good - enjoyed the different take on this well-known franchise!,1
5.0,movie was very good. enjoyed every minute. the action is amazing and the storyline is unlike the other Batman movies we have seen,1
2.0,"Too much ""Dark,"" not enough ""Knight."" Knew I was gonna have issue with this when Bruce is giving the ""you're not my father,"" spiel 20 minutes in. Eisenberg acts ""more like Riddler than Luthor"" in BvS, and all's well. Dano does his best Professor Pyg, calls it the Riddler, and is applauded? Inconsistent, much?",-1
4.5,Best Batman movie ever,1
5.0,"Really well done, Great selection of actors, great story. I would of went with Selena.",1
5.0,"Very good movie. Emotional, action packed, murder mystery.",1
4.0,I enjoyed this exciting movie from start to finish.,1
4.5,"Movie was good, casting was making me wonder at first, but after watching the movie the casting makes it perfect",1
5.0,"Great moviemy kid loved it as well,..",1
4.5,"Wow. I really liked this film. A dark, gritty, grounded detective Batman story. Just off my first watch, I liked pretty much everything about it. The cast, the villains, story, all of it. Robert Pattinson does a fantastic job as Bruce/Batman. Zoe Kravitz shines as well. And Paul Dano gives a terrifying performance as the riddler. Just great. I also liked Jeffrey Wright & Colin Farrell in their roles too. It was cool and fun to kind of figure out the riddles with Batman as the film goes on. That was a nice touch and a plus. The whole detective angle is something I really enjoyed. Also that chase scene was thrilling and very well done. I was on the edge of my seat. I‚Äôve never been a big Batman fan, however I think with this film they won me over. I would love to see a sequel and what do next!",1
5.0,"I‚Äôm a huge Batman fan, and this is the Best Batman movie I‚Äôve seen! I could go on and on , but this was an absolute pleasure to watch!",1
4.0,Hopeful for the next film the DC Villains will appear with there actual outfits from the comics,1
4.0,"TOO LONG, but pretty good.",1
5.0,"Probably the best rendition of Batman in my opinion. It is dark, gritty. and it shows Batman near his beginnings, growing from a feared symbol of vengeance and violent judgement, to the symbol of hope that we all know and love! If you like Batman then this is a must watch.",1
5.0,A long movie but action-packed from start to finish. I loved it.,1
5.0,"Suspense and dark tone were amazingly well done. In the theatre, sound seemed to reverb through our seats. Total suspension of disbelief -- a sign of an excellent movie. Robert Pattison was a great pick in the largely young cast.",1
3.0,"Based on reviews I expected this movie to stand out. Understandably the character of Batman has always been the brooding, dark type which Robert plays really well ( may be so well that I did not feel a connection with his character- he was depressing). The story on the other hand, drags, does not develop the character of Bruce Wayne into the wealthy philanthropist that he is known to be, it fails to develop the other characters as well, touching briefly here and there on them and focusing on Gordon/Batman for most of the time. The biggest Negative to me is that it fails to keep us on the edge of our seats- they build some suspense but dilutes it down with the slow pace instead of taking us into more and more suspense until the final reveal. The ending was also not satisfying - we expected a more conclusive one I think. Overall yes it was entertaining but I fail to see how this movie is 'the best' batman ever!",0
2.5,very hard to hear them speaking!!!,-1
4.0,The storyline was pretty good,1
1.5,Way too dark to really see and hard to follow.,-1
4.0,"Seemed easier to follow and a bit smarter, more realistic and easier to pay attention than previous Batmans. Also really good casting.",1
5.0,All the actors rocked,1
3.0,It was ok. Not enough action for me but it was just ok. it took so long to get the storyline going. It just wasn't that good.,0
0.5,I could barely hear the dialogue. It was very slow and didnt give me the Batman vibes ya know.,-1
2.5,It felt like I had seen it before. It also felt long.,-1
1.0,My kids and I all fell asleep. Horribly boring.,-1
5.0,Best Batman yet. Gotham was like a character in the movie. Highly recommend.,1
2.5,Overall it was OK. The sound was way too low and I found myself straining to hear much of the dialogue. The action was good and the story was OK but the sound almost ruined it for me.,-1
2.5,Too long a movie. It was a sphagetti of a convoluted plot.,-1
4.0,Way more detective oriented and i loved that. Great setting. Great acting. Great story.,1
5.0,Absolutely immersive and realistic. Best. Batman. Movie,1
2.5,2.5 might be generous.,-1
5.0,Best Batman movie! Lots of action!,1
5.0,It was so good! RPatz is my Batman! It was a great look into Batman becoming the hero we are used to. Also this Batman doesn‚Äôt believe in the use of guns! Woot woot!!,1
5.0,"Fantastic movie...feels like I was watching the comic book come to life. Patterson did great as a young Bruce Wayne, im excited to see his development in the upcoming movies. The rest of the cast were all great as well. We finally saw Batman as the world's greatest detective in this movie. It was a different take on the character compared to past movies. 9 out of 10.",1
5.0,Liked that it was earlier in Batmans story.,1
0.5,"I am a huge fan of superhero movies, especially DC But man, they will never be able to make a decent live action movie. The pacing was SO slow, the script was terrible, the characters had no development whatsoever, and, most of all , the plot was 1 dimensional Gotta say, I was extremely excited to see this movie and wouldve left the theater early if I hadnt paid so much to see it.",-1
1.0,"By far the worst Batman movie! There was no character development, and the story line was pitiful.",-1
4.0,"For a storyline that is already played out, this was quite a fresh take. Very enjoyable!",1
5.0,Great movie... other than the length I can't really complain about anything. Don't stick around for the post credit clip... almost worthless,1
2.0,"This movie felt like it was trying too hard to fill the shoes of the dark Arkham comics. Bland dialogue and pitch-black lighting makes this movie drag. To round it all out, the acting was only mediocre, with flashes of decent performance here and there. Unless you are a diehard Batman or DC fan, this movie is not worth watching.",-1
5.0,Truest Batman connection to the comics!,1
4.0,"It has a stylistic noir feel. The cinematography and storyline were interesting, but the movie lacked character development. Also, the pace seemed to drag and it could have likely been improved through editing and fewer dramatic visuals.",1
4.5,"One of the best Batman movies out there, we haven't seen the caped crusader since Justice League but that is an entirely different bat. If you're hungry for a new and in my opinion better Batman then I highly recommend you go see this film! Now this film isn't perfect no movie is but it will definitely satisfy that Batman craving you may have plus if you're a fan of Robert Pattinson then you will be happy with his performance in this movie. This movie is absolutely amazing so just go see it I can guarantee you will love it if not at least enjoy it, this film is a Batman film you won't want to miss!!!",1
1.0,Too dark. Not for kids. Didn‚Äôt like the new Batman.,-1
3.5,"Movie was good, WAY too long. Couldve been shortened by an hour easily. But good characters, and good ending that suggests more to come.",0
2.5,Its such a realistic movie but quite Melancholic all throughout. Kept me feeling on the edge of my seat,-1
5.0,great batman the best one i like addie from dark night,1
4.5,The service was great and The Batman is awesome though long,1
5.0,"Amazing story. More of a mystery/detective movie than a superhero movie. Best all-around Batman movie ever produced. And thats saying a lot, because there were so many good ones prior.",1
5.0,awesome movie great story and action üëçüèæüëçüèæ,1
5.0,Loved everything about it!,1
5.0,wonderful. hope they make a few more. great casting.,1
5.0,A true comic book detective Batman.,1
0.5,Didn't feel like a Batman movie. It felt like a moody mafia movie rather than a hero movie.,-1
5.0,Amazing!! Characterization perfect!!,1
3.5,It was too long & dark.,0
5.0,"Robert Pattinson made The Batman his own unique version in this adaptation. He didn't use a raspy growl when speaking which was a relief. There was no air of flamboyance, privilege or wealth. Pattinsons Batman was dark, gloomy yet exciting. Highly recommend seeing it to all.",1
2.0,Too long. Riddler was hyper-annoying,-1
4.0,W Movie fr but dark knight,1
3.0,it was just fine. slow steady and no surprises,0
5.0,"That movie SURPRISED ME. Expectations were a tad lower for it compared to Nolans films but this Batman you cant really compare to Christan Bales role because they have different approachs to the comic. This film here had a darker approach and felt so natural to Batmans character. Acting was great, all around experience was amazing.",1

4.0,"I really liked this darker take on the Batman franchise, although at some points it did feel like it was dragging on.",1
5.0,This film is amazing!!,1
5.0,"The uniqueness of this Batman is the artistry.  If you watch the movie a second time, I encourage you to pay attention to the cinematography, the lighting, the framing of the scenes, the  intentionally slow pacing, and the music - all of which work together in a noir harmony not often seen in action movies today.  The directors used lenses which were intentionally warped or distorted in certain ways and they also make use of focus and un-focus which brings you into the movie.  The music sets a dour tone reminiscent of gothic Edgar Allen Poe, further reinforced by the subtle yet over the top gothic decor of Wayne Manor.  The color theme: bronze (as bright as things ever get), red, and black, permeate throughout.  Some might criticise the music for its simplicity, but music should never distract from the movie and the tempo and tone I think reinforces the dour, gothic, brooding nature of Bruce Wayne and the mystery theme and also seamlessly transitions between batman and cat woman when they are on screen together.  The performances were quite good overall as well.  Overall, an immersive world that gets better on the second viewing.",1
3.5,"The beginning of the movie showcased a strong start with some dark disturbing thriller crime detective scenes. The middle segment of the movie was necessary for the plot, but I wasn't that interested in the emotional investment in catwoman's problems, batman and alfred's relationship, or the relationship between batman and catwoman. I enjoyed little jokes with the same nightclub's door bouncers always getting beat up. I thought the colin farrell did an excellent job as the penguin, as did all the other actors with their respective roles. The batman's theme was fantastic, I enjoy listening to it over and over. I enjoyed movie overall.",0

1.5,"First hour-and-a-half are AMAZING, then it just falls apart- a good hour of pure exposition dumps and a completely bizarre while somehow at the same time, flat finale. Batman loses BAD. Very depressing film. It only builds you up to smash you down.",-1

3.5,"The movie was recommended to me by a relative... she said that it was extremely funny. Unfortunately, it wasn't as funny as I had hoped. The trailer did not show enough of the movie to make an accurate determination to see the movie. If it had I would not have taken my 86 YO mother. We would have seen a different movie and I would have Free Guy alone or with someone else. It as just okay.",0
3.5,It was pretty good. More funny towards the end. Weird cheesy AI romance was kinda weird. Other than that it‚Äôs aight,0
4.5,"Advice: WATCH THIS IN IMAX! There are several scenes that warrant the immersion of visual scale and sound intensity you get with IMAX. My Spoiler-Free Take: Free Guy was thoroughly entertaining as an action-comedy, but I was pleasantly surprised by its depth-- exploring love, interpersonal connection, betrayal, and courage. The premise of the film isn't timeless, and that's a good thing it IS very much an exploration of how the resolution of digital reality will shape our human experience as we enter the age of the VR multiverse.",1
4.0,"At its core it's a pretty fun movie. I think overall more could have been done with it that would have made it great, but overall Ryan Reynolds and this world do a great job keeping me entertained throughout.

If you play a lot of Video Games you will not have a tuff time following this movie? I can see why is doing so well in the box office? It attracting a younger audiences. It has somewhat of a story line. If you're not into Video Games this may not be the movie for you (just my opinion).",0

4.0,Fun summer movie. Smart as usual with Ryan Reynolds involved. Four of my kids and I saw it together and we all enjoyed it.

(as did most of the audience) Ryan Reynolds is very Ryan Reynolds but with a nativity that only an NPC could have. I enjoyed all of the supporting cast as well, especially Channing Tatum's small parts which show my favorite parts of his personality the comedy and the dancing! The story line is a little silly at times but also quite heart warming. If you enjoyed West World, Dead Pool & Ready Player One then you'll probably enjoy this as it mashed together West World & Ready Player One in a way and added the humor from the writers and star of DeadPool.",1

Finally, a film that recaptures the essence of transporting its viewers to another world where they can forget their troubles for a little while. While most of Hollywood is focusing on being politically woke, this refreshing tale harkens back to the golden days of entertainment when they actually produced works of art meant to entertain, while also reaching a new generation of viewers with its modern-day video game setting. Take all your family and friends and watch this gem in a movie theater near you! You wont be disappointed, and you may even forget about the woes of this world for a little while. Go, Free Guy!",1
5.0,"Must See Movie! Jodie Comer, Joe ""the Hair"" Keesey, Channing Tatum and Ryan Reynolds are a hoot to watch! Taika Wattiti is always a joy to watch as a villain. A great fun time! Take your friend and family. Great for kids, geeks, nerds and senior citizens",1

1.5,"No justice to the first. Felt more like a stand alone film that was made just to set up the next, but it never really set itself to be anything but okay. I can watch the first film from time to time and it never gets old. This one got stale half way through the very first time watching. I hope the next installment is better... way better.",-1

5.0,Amazing movie. This is how to film an underwater movie.,1
5.0,"The story line , humans bad indigenous people good.Watching the first half of the movie made me feel how in this world some humans can be unkind to others because of greed and status. Family above all else reigns supreme",1
5.0,Wonderful film and my family enjoyed it! Visually beautiful ü§©,1
1.5,"Beautiful spectacle, stunning cinematography and awesome 3D, plus a great, immersive Dolby Atmos soundtrack with an orchestral and choral score that will carry you into that realm of other worldlyness, but none of that is powerful enough to hold interest in the practically none-existent storyline or repetitive and, frankly quite, the long, boring fights and explosions and chases and fights and explosions and chases and fights and explosions, etc. And even those you've seen many times in many other action movies to the point where they almost have a decidedly old, cliche look -- oh yeah, seen that before...and that...that too...etc. And all the noise and mindless nonsense goes on for what feels like forever -- with that 300 million dollars that this overblown mindless sequel cost to make, seems like they literally forget to hire an EDITOR! This thing goes on for 3 effen hours. You could lop off 1 & a half and although you still would get a worn-out, seen-it-all-before plot and terrible dialog, you wouldn't waste 3 hours of your life. If you could see it in 3D and in a theatre that was presenting it in Dolby Atmos sound, then I would say, go for the spectacle and beautify of the cinematography and the lushes surround sound of the score -- like in an IMAX 3D theatre where I saw it, but even then, it might be better to go while you are microdosing so your mind is already numb. Other than that -- go get the BluRay and watch the first one instead even if you saw it already -- it's 10 years old and you will find that much more rewarding.",-1
5.0,This is the 2nd time I've seen it & it was even better the second time . Loved watching it. Was a great movie. Kept my interested the whole time. And a must see on the big screen & in 3D too. . Don't wait to see it on TV.,1

5.0,Loved it. 3d effects were amazing.,1
5.0,"It was my second time seeing it and I think everyone would benefit, I noticed more about the movie that I may have missed before because of the enchantment of ""the water"" and the amazing production. I enjoyed it a lot. Plus, some good life lessons in the movie.",1
1.0,The water visuals were superb the plot was pedestrian and predictable. The producers should be ashamed for using the harpoon in the fin plot line - ancient. The entire movie showed a total lack of imagination.,-1
5.0,"Well...there were minor glitches with the 3D at first but once that was corrected the movie was one of the best I have seen years and look forward to the next Avatar, whenever it comes out.",1
5.0,I've watched Avatar 135 times. This viewing was 136 and OH MY JEEBUS... by far the BEST EXPERIENCE ü§Ø Visual quality & Sound quality TOP NOTCH ü§åüèª Well worth flying from Honolulu to watch Avatar 2 for some of the last screenings üíô‚ú®,1

3.5,The visuals were amazing and there are some deeper meanings behind all of the flashiness. Just wish that the antagonists and plot wasn‚Äôt so similar to the first movie.,0
5.0,"I loved every bit of it. Although it‚Äôs long, it‚Äôs sections are very good",1
4.0,"Avatar: The Way of Water has some of the most beautiful special effects ever seen in the history of filmmaking. However, be warned. I read that unlike the first film, which was about the greed of capitalism, the evils of the military, the destruction caused by technology, and the superiority of primitive tribes over modern culture, that this sequel was about family and family values. Unfortunately, I had been misinformed.",1
5.0,Can‚Äôt believe how amazing this movie looked. Great film.,1

5.0,Great movie loved the story and great setup for the 3rd,1

5.0,Great story and great graphic!,1
4.5,I don‚Äôt like Miles üòÇ he won‚Äôt leave the Navi alone üò≠,1
3.0,Beautiful cinematography and animation. Too long and slow in the middle of the movie.,0
4.5,"Well told story.Took it's time to tell it right. Could have used a new premise instead of rehashing the same old baddy. BTW, I thought the first base was small because of limited resources. Couldn't fly all that metal that far in space and Pandora was a metal poor planet? All of a sudden we can build a monstrous city and rail lines? ...",1
5.0,"Good movie with lots of action and great characters, loved the scenery. Beautiful.",1

5.0,Great visual effects. Excellent movie.,1
4.5,The photography and story line was very moving. The water scenes were spectacular.,1
5.0,"this is why many of us go to the movies. It took a large team of humans a lot of work to make this, and it delivers the goods.... excellent entertainment! You may want to avoid if you don't like guns, explosions, or killing in your cinema. The acting, camera work, 3d effects were in a good pocket, the camera, graphics, and score are excellent... nice to return to Pandora once again!",1
5.0,My husband loved it!,1

4.0,The movie was rather long...and if you don't care for slow paced action then this is not for you!!,1
5.0,loved the movie and the music and animation,1
5.0,Awesome movie. Better than the first. Looking forward to the next.,1

5.0,Loved the realistic water scenes.,1
1.0,I was so disappointed in Avatar 2. The story line was light and the violence just went on and on. This movie could have been an hour shorter and still covered the story. I cannot recommend it at all.,-1
4.0,as before the production design is gorgeous. some of the script didn't make sense like what happened to all the water people later in the big fight. and you have to wait too long for the evil guys get theirs.,1
5.0,Loved love love this movie!,1
5.0,Visually incredible the 3 d really made it pop,1
3.5,"It seemed like they drug it out way too much, it doesn't need to be that long.",0
3.5,Of course it was visually stunning and I like the look of the new people. The story was the same as first movie and predictable. The baddies were very bad and good people very innocent.,0
4.0,Visuals were awesome! Story was engaging but SO VIOLENT!,1
0.5,"no story, no script, effects were terrible, especially the last action scene, characters move in fast motion like the Benny Hill Show.",-1

5.0,CGI WAS AWESOME Movie way to long.. story needed to move along,1
5.0,"Very good movie a bit long, but very good! It was left open for a 3rd! Can't wait!",1
4.0,"Worth the wait but I feel like it could have been, I don't know, different. I guess predictable might be the right word. No doubt, it was one of the best movies I'll see this year but I do like a plot line that makes me think a little bit more. The story line was a little mundane but otherwise it lived up to the expectation. Special effects were amazing, emotionally impactful (my eyes were leaking a little) and solid acting from the kids, aside from a lack of character development to fill some plot holes. 3D was pretty cool and by far the most imaginative world on the big screen this year.",1
4.0,"Slow start, all action at end of movie",1
4.5,The movie was amazing I recommend watching in 3D it‚Äôs better than standard.,1
5.0,Grear movie with many great effects!,1
4.5,My Bsf and mom really liked it n so did i,1
5.0,"the concept is great/timely/daring./caring/responsible, like no other hollywood film. 10 years in the making & only 1 oscar?! hollywood/oscars suck and diminish James Cameron as developing shallow characters when the point is not characters but ecology / world peace / spirituality / universality! to top it all off, lets respect the 10 years of 100s of peoples work, effort, genius. not to mention the most incredible & realistic life-like cgi/special effects ever. what has our western world come down to, when the oscar goes to fat gay peoples rights over the attention to our sole Planets survival?! screw political correctness when theres much more at stake than individuals rights. i have tourette syndrome but do not ask for attention, what matters is the planet, all people, all species, all plants, not competition, not survival of the fittest colonizers, not individual equality punitive laws & marketing hype, not different form of government or teligions, that all failed anyway, but universality & planetarianism, the pnly neutral solution.",1
3.0,the cinematics were great. the story was not very good. too many plot holes. a lot of the same tactics were used at the end of the movie. idk.. it just felt like a lot of scenes were unnecessary and was made to just make it as long as possible.,0
5.0,Movie was technically brilliant.,1
2.0,"3d effects were very disappointing, the film was unnecessarily too long and the story line was weak.",-1
5.0,"The most beautiful movie , from Disney, ever!! I enjoyed the view under water in 3 D!!!",1
5.0,I thought it was better than the first one the story was a little weak. 3D was totally the way to watch this movie. I would recommend this film,1
5.0,"I really enjoyed the story line, the effects, and cinematography.",1
4.5,Loved the storyline and comfy seating for almost a 4 hr stretch. But seriously why do you allow people with children under 5 years old. My tickets were 20 and I had to listen to babys all throughout the movie. Thats bull shit. The man next to us also brought young kids that kept stepping all over their seats doing circles. Get a babysitter or dont go. Terrible that I have to pay the price for their ignorance. Its downright rude. That movie avatar isnt for kids under 13. They dont even understand whats going on. It was highly distracting and people coughing up phlegm disgusting. No instructions on where the seat control are. I hadnt been in a while so I didnt realize they reclined so caught that in time before movie started. But seriously the whole thing with that family that brought two small children one of those a baby. I could hear them the entire time. Maybe offer headset plug in to drown them the f out.,1
5.0,Loved this movie. The animation was incredible and the characters very lifelike. Would recommend this movie highly!,1
5.0,This movie proves that the sequel can be better than the first movie! The storyline was amazing and so was the action.,1
5.0,Very very good movie,1
5.0,"I'm glad that they followed the same base line as the first movie, the graphics were outstanding and the story line was great, they left it open for a part 3 and I can't wait to see what they do next.",1
5.0,One of the best movies Ive ever seen. All the special effects are Great.,1
4.0,was good movie but a bit long,1
3.0,Kind of slow and did drag a little bit. Background was great.,0
5.0,It was amazing. So worth it. I can't wait for a third one. The action was better then the first one. The only thing that sucked was me and my daughter didn't have 3d glasses like everyone else so it was hard to see at times but it was amazing.,1
3.5,The movie was interesting...a bit too long...but the theater experience was not so good. Sevel young children were in the theater and caused a lot of distractions....,0
4.5,It had alot of action. The 3 hours went by very fast.,1
2.5,The first movie introduced this world but this second assumed we remembered it all. And 190 minutes plus 20 In previews a lot to ask,-1
5.0,Awesome new adventure,1
5.0,"Not quite a stunning as the first, but well worth the watch time of over three hours",1
4.0,Very much enjoyed the movie.,1
5.0,I wish it wasnt so long or theres a built intermission. It was long m,1
5.0,"WOW - Much Better Than Expected... I bought tickets on a whim after hearing that it was the most expensive film ever made. On the way to the theater, we were having buyer's remorse(we are in our late 60's). The first Avatar had been a disappointment. But the instant the movie began we were all in :-) 3D has come a long way - The visual impact of the movie is FANTASTIC!!! One could mention a few plot areas that could be improved, but why- This is a FANTASTIC visual experience!!!",1
1.0,A little disappointed in the beginning.,-1
4.5,Great movie! Loved it!,1
2.5,"The story wasn't much, more of a re-hash of the first one. The special affects were pretty good though, I like these movies for that. The script left a lot to be desired, ""go, go,go""",-1
5.0,Excellent movie to experiencelove the water scenes and excellent direction.,1
5.0,"So good! Very long movie, but so good!",1
3.5,"Predictable, but just as beautiful as the original",0
5.0,"Too too long, but great graphics especially the Avatars, the ocean and sea animals were so colorful and beautiful. The movie had lots of good action scenes and storyline was good but I thought it had to much fighting which made it not great.",1
0.5,The 3d made me sick and I had to leave 30 minutes into the movie. I became very dizzy and nauseous. I researched the film and saw that the frame rate switches throughout the film causing motion sickness to some. I have watched movies in 3d before without any issues. I would like a refund.,-1
5.0,Incredible visual effects snd a powerful story of family. This Avatar's a winner!,1
5.0,"Avatar 2 is a thoroughly entertaining and engaging second edition in the series. James Cameron has created a refreshingly beautiful world, Pandora, populated by an amazing, spiritually-centered species, the Navi. Be sure to see it in 3D nobody utilizes the technology with more finesse than Cameron.",1
5.0,Liked everything about it.,1
5.0,Spectacular visual effects. Family oriented story.,1
5.0,Beautiful movie!!! You must watch it!!!,1

2.5,just felt like a really long cartoon,-1
5.0,"This is perhaps the best action movie that I have ever seen. The visual and auditory effects immerse you and make you a part of the action. Despite so much of the movie being CGI, my wife was moved to tears. I was awed by the visuals and did not even realize that we had been sitting there for over 3 hours.",1
2.0,I‚Äôm so disappointed in this movie‚Ä¶ The plot was terrible the the general from the first movie died and came back a avatar!? This movie just didn‚Äôt make sense especially the whale scenes. In my opinion this movie was a total bust :(,-1
5.0,I would give this masterpiece infinite stars!!!!...It was out of this world brilliant!!!!...Bring kleenex!!!...It gets emotional...And see it in 3D!!!!....My Mom and I are coming back with my older brother 100%...Please see it in 3D...I will be seeing it multiple times!!! LoveLoveLoved it!!!!,1
5.0,Everything from start to finish was over the top!,1
5.0,"The 3 hours went by fast! Special effects were very well done, exceptional. Story kept me engaged, not like other action films where there appears to be no plot or underlying message. Story focused on family togetherness and the plight of indigenous people when conquerors invade.",1

5.0,I enjoyed the graphics and plot,1

5.0,great movie! hopefully it doesn't take 10 years to come out with the next one.,1
5.0,"It was a great out of this world experience. I especially liked viewing it in 3D. Although the plot was a bit old, I particularly enjoyed the creation of this other planet called Pandora. Looks like with the survival of the villain there will be an Avatar 3.",1
4.0,Enjoyed this film as much as the first Avatar. Didn't need the 3D.,1
4.5,The movie was amazing. I couldn‚Äôt expect the scenario to be creatively extended.,1
5.0,The movie was awesome.,1
5.0,Special Effects were awesome. Story line believable,1

5.0,"Great effects, not bad for a sequel",1
5.0,"So nice I saw it twice, a beautiful movie that is well paced, as interesting and investing than the first, and is worth seeing in 3D or Imax for a big screen experience you will not forget!",1
5.0,"Amazing movie, heart touching, with beautiful visuals!",1
3.5,"The technical aspects of the film have grown since 2009, but it doesnt seem like a script thats been honed over a decade. I know, I know. They probably had to lock the script in like 2017. The movie as a whole isnt bad though.",0
2.0,Very disappointed. No real story line just fighting.,-1
5.0,Absolutely loved the movie and can‚Äôt wait for the next one!,1
5.0,Great movie it was like you were actually on pandora. Diving in the clear oceans swimming with the fish and soaring through the air. The only critique would be the ending because it didnt at all feel like it was an ending at all,1
3.0,Cut out 40 minutes. Then you'll have a good movie.,0
5.0,Loved the visual imagery and the relationship between main characters and how well the first movie was blended into the second.,1
5.0,Wonderful effects. Lots of action.,1
3.0,Same plot as first movie,0
5.0,The movie was full of adventure and much like the first the storyline was exceptional- its as good as the first and doesnt even feel like the movie is over 3hours long- its absolutely worth watching!,1
5.0,Great imagination and fabulous CGI,1
5.0,A little long but held my interest the whole time,1
5.0,Little long but love the views,1
4.0,amazing cinematography,1
5.0,Beautiful! Well worth the wait in my opinion‚Ä¶,1
5.0,"Amazing in 3 D and the 3 hrs goes so fast. Awesome movie, highly recommend",1
5.0,visually stunning especially in 3D.,1
5.0,Well thought out. Beautiful graphics.,1
4.0,There wasnt enough bright colors. The movie king of dragged on. But I enjoyed it very much,1
4.5,"The 3D was awesome. The movie was good, took my Granddaughter to see it. She said it was really good",1
5.0,Loved it! Makes me hate to be a human. Lol. But the movie over all was great!,1
5.0,3 d movie and we didnt get 3d glassed,1
5.0,well done sequel with the potential for an additional one to round out the trilogy...,1
4.0,"banal dialogue, most characters looked alike and didn't have much character, way too long, What I did like: the action and special effects",1
4.5,"Great story, incredible graphics, and a nice sequel. While a long movie, it went very quickly and I wanted more.",1
4.0,Visual effects were amazing.,1
4.0,"Excellent special effects, and the Digital 3D was well done. If you've ever done SCUBA diving on tropical reefs, you'll appreciate all the beautifully done underwater scenes. Plot & dialogue was a bit contrived in spots but - no surprise - the good guys always win in the end.",1
5.0,It was good but I didn‚Äôt like it in 3D,1
5.0,The visuals are amazing!!,1
3.0,I left after 2 hours... it did not measure up to the first movie...,0
4.5,As in the first Avatar movie - it was the cinematography that captured me from the opening scenes. I took my grandson last night - we BOTH loved it.,1
5.0,"Incredible, all Movies pale in comparison!",1
4.0,I went to see Avatar: The Way of Water without any preconceived ideas formed from other peoples opinions. The story kept my interest the action scenes moved things along and it did not drag. The 3-D glasses really enhanced the underwater scenes. I had a positive experience and enjoyed the fantasy.,1
5.0,Dont listen to the critics. Avatar 2 was AMAZING!!! Every bit as good as Avatar 1!!! The story line was good and the special effects were GREAT!!!,1
5.0,I loved the movie unfortunately I didnt know I needed 3D glasses. The theatre did not provide them. Sent me another ticket. I love to see this movie again properly.,1
5.0,AWSOME movie hope it doesnt take so long for the next one,1
4.0,Too long but visuals are amazing,1
5.0,"Beautiful water scenes, very captivating!",1
5.0,It was awesome! You have to see it in 3D!!,1
4.0,Great special effects,1
5.0,I saw it in 3D and it was amazing. The special effects were awesome. A little long but well worth it,1
5.0,"Excellent movie , special effects were awesome, loved it",1
4.5,"The movie and the special effects were excellent. We hope to see another version of Avatar to come out soon. The only gripe I had was Regal had a ceiling light up next to the screen that didn't dim properly so we had to get someone to try to dim it, and they ended up having to shut them all off!",1
5.0,"Overall, Avatar 2 is a remarkable achievement in filmmaking that lives up to the high expectations set by its predecessor. It's a thrilling, emotional, and visually stunning experience that is sure to be remembered as one of the best films of the year.",1
4.0,"The storyline is good, there's drama, action, and suspense. Actors did well thou some are not. Watching in 3D, the pretty colors stand up.",1
2.0,This movie is ridiculously slow and long. It also needed more backstory set up because it has been so many years since the prior version was out. The characters seemed shallow and cheesy.,-1
5.0,"All I'm saying is if you enjoyed the first movie, you'll absolutely love this one too !",1
4.0,"Effects were great, the story was a great addition to the original and well planned. The one thing that I was slightly disappointed with was the whole this was not crystal clear, a bit fuzzy. I enjoyed it but that caught me in the beggining and rode all the way through.",1
5.0,Great visual effects !! Really good watch on 3D!! Story was good was entertained the whole time watching the movie I didn‚Äôt want it to end !!,1
3.0,Just didnt have the action like the 1st Avatar!,0
5.0,The movie was slow to build but it was well worth the wait.,1
5.0,Loved it. Better than the first one!,1
3.0,"I think the special effects were amazing. However, I dont feel we needed to watch so many battle scenes.",0
3.0,"I had high hopes for this film after the first one, especially after James Cameron took so long to release a second one I thought it was going to be one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. While entertaining in terms of the scenery and special effects, I found it to be terribly disappointing. The plot is so weak I am not sure it is a plot at all. A revenge story with a mediocre character that died in the first film for over 3 hours? Yikes. I kept thinking, ""there must be more to do this,"" but there wasn't. There were many, many holes throughout, in relationships especially...I could not connect with the characters so loved from the first film nor any of the new characters. I gave it three stars because I probably would have still watched it at home at some point, just to have seen it, but I would not have wasted a night at the theater, especially for how long it is.",0
5.0,"Great and entertaining movie!!! If you watch the first movie, this one is even better!! Loved the story line. Its a 3 hour movie and it didnt feel it was that long.",1
4.0,"great visuals, no depth",1
5.0,Definitely would watch again!!,1
5.0,3D was fun to watch. great movie.,1
5.0,The movie was amazing!! Was just as good if not better than the first,1
5.0,"Great movie, super entertaining.",1
1.0,The only thing I liked about this movie was the popcorn.,-1
5.0,"Great special effects, loved the story and characters. The 3 hours went by really fast.",1
5.0,Movie was awesome I would so recommend it,1
5.0,Didn‚Äôt disappoint at all. Amazing,1
4.0,It was too too long. No move should be more than 2 hours.,1
5.0,So much action keeps you entertained the whole movie! Well done! Love this movie worth the watch!,1
5.0,excellant. Helps if you saw the original first but really don't have too,1
3.0,"The movie was great, we paid for 3d and the movie was not shown in 3d nor was the sound great either at Parks Mall in Arlington, TX",0
5.0,"This was the third time I saw it with a friend or family, but the first time was the glasses. It was like a whole new movie! Everything came to life! Loved it!",1
1.0,"Beautiful visuals and an extremely stupid, repetitive script. When will the sky people find another planet to pick on? How many times are those kids gonna be in danger?",-1
5.0,Loved seeing this in 3D. Waited years for this and it was well worth the wait. Highly recommend you get out to the theatre and see this movie!,1
4.5,Great movie! 3d spectacular,1
4.0,"The over all movie was good, however I think that there was more emphasis on the killing of the movies type of whales for profit.",1
5.0,It was worth the wait! Very much enjoyed it and it was a good story line. Very long but never boring.,1
5.0,The traffics in real 3-D were FANTASTIC. THE NEW STORY LINE WAS TOTALLY AWESOME. DEFINITELY ADDING TO MY COLLECTION ONE OF THE YEARS BEST MOVIES!!!,1
5.0,Fantastic experience! Each scene was a masterpiece!,1
3.0,Too long. Weak story. Annoying characters.,0
5.0,Visually stunning. Slow buildup but the story took off and fully engaged for a great ride.,1
5.0,Fantastic in every way!,1
5.0,The sound and picture quality was superb!!!,1
5.0,I loved the movie and 3D was perfect,1
5.0,"There was nothing in the movie I didnt like, the theatre thats a different story. Rude talking and bothering people was a group of 4 teenagers. Very sad parents cant teach their children to act right",1
5.0,"Action, Special Effects, Movie con",1
2.0,"There was a not-so-subtle moral of self-hatred to the story . . . one where the primitives who are in touch with nature in a spiritual way are the good guys and the modern industrial capitalistic exploiters of the living world are the bad guys. Nevertheless, the 3-D glasses worked well and the cinematography was beautiful (despite so many scenes of violence). As a Marine Corps veteran, I recognized a lot of authentic lingo. Overall, the only way I could recommend this movie is if you are willing to set aside a little time to read Ayn Rand's _Return of the Primitive: The Anti-Industrial Revolution_.",-1
4.5,It was great Watch 1st one before,1
5.0,I amazed at the quality of the movie it was brilliant thanks James Cameron,1
5.0,I only can said WAOOOO,1
4.5,Definitely worth seeing in 3D--other extra formats not essential. Brings back memories of rooting against the human race during the first one back in 2009.,1
5.0,Visually well done 3D ... see it on the big screen.,1
4.0,it was action packed,1
5.0,Very beautiful movie,1
3.5,"A pretty good movie, the pacing was off a bit and at times it was predictable. But a good sequel to the original.",0
5.0,I loved the new Avatar: The Way of Water! What fantastic special effects as well as a good story.,1
5.0,Very good. Sad plot though and a bit gory,1
4.0,It felt like it wS building up for the third one,1
5.0,Great movie had some sad parts but definitely will watch it again!!,1
2.5,Good enough. Worth seeing in theaters but largely disappointing. Too many loose ends. Bogus ending.,-1
0.5,"This sequel arrives dead in the water, especially when compared to the original. The story, what there is of one, is drawn out and unoriginal. The CGI is similar to a video game.",-1
5.0,Would go see it again,1
5.0,this is a must see. best movie I have seen in a few years.,1
3.0,It was kind of bored at beginning then it was ok,0
5.0,"James Cameron and his team did it again! They managed to make an almost 3 hr film fly by. The CGI does not disappoint, Pandoras water clan and ecology made me fall in love all over again with the magic of the Avatar people. The storyline, characters and script allowed the Avatar world to expand without losing its heart.",1
5.0,"exciting, moving, emotional, beautiful‚Ä¶.",1
5.0,"Avatar: The Way of Water kept my attention from start to finish. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and I'm looking forward to the 3rd Avatar. I'll stay tuned for another great sequel!",1
5.0,Big action! Great special effects!! Was a bit long‚Ä¶.,1
5.0,Had me holding my breathe half the time. Loved it and better than the first.,1
4.0,"Gorgeous world - loved the move to the water domain and the amazing creatures and people of that area. Compelling story line of family, people and love of the creatures of the world. The first Avatar was the pinnacle of use of 3D in my opinion and this one kept that use going. Integral to the story and the world, and not shlocky effects. Some of the intro to the water world could have been trimmed as the movie was quite long!",1
4.0,Interesting but too long,1
5.0,Amazing better than the first one. Cant wait to see the next 3d was spectacular not a dull moment.,1
1.0,Worst dialogue so awkward,-1
5.0,"We really loved this movie! It felt as if we were a part of the film due to the 3D effects. The story was a little hard to understand because it was a long time since we saw the first Avatar show, but it still exceeded expectations.",1
4.5,animation and colors. good 3D glasses,1
4.5,"It wasnt just a movie, it was an experience!!! 5 stars hands down.",1
1.5,No real start to movie. Way too long. Boring in many places.,-1
5.0,I liked how it didn‚Äôt seem corny and it was as previewed. I disliked Nati died. Tears tears tears,1
5.0,People kept talking loud,1
5.0,Story Line was good. The special effects were outstanding.,1
3.5,Slow in the beginning but the action picked up and the 3 hours went by quick. Story was predictable but nice visual effects and fun to watch.,0
4.5,Loved family values. The comradary within tribes. I was Allen aback by so much aggression and violence. Especially towards animal species. Amazing how kids turned out.,1
5.0,Makes me wanna suck on some blue toes.,1
5.0,This was hands down a GREAT MOVIE I LOVED IT THERE WAS SO MUCH ACTION and EMOTION. Especially in 3D that was dope as &@? I would go again and Id purchase it on DVD!,1
4.0,"The CGI was great, but movie was awfully long.",1
4.5,Entertaining but a little confusing first watch through. Second watch it was even better than the first. Brilliant escapism.,1
5.0,It was a good part 2,1
3.5,Way too long! I believe they could have edited this better. I thought the special effects were really well done and 3D has come quite a ways. But I think 2 to 2.5 hours is preferable to over 3 hours.,0
3.0,It was ok. I am a huge fan of the original Avatar but I honestly feel like way of the water had no real plot. The movie is 3 plus hours for no reason. I hope the next Avatar is not as boring.,0
4.0,The 3D was awesome the detail in everything was amazing.that being said I left the theater hoping we never find life on another planet 70% of the movie is just cruelty to nature the other 30% is getting you to love the wildlife and everything to do with the world of avatar if you cant stand movies where animals die this will not be something to watch,1
5.0,The visuals in this movie were suburb! Great story line as usual and the cast was also well picked. A must see!,1
4.0,"Well done, but to long , the first hour & half was dragging to me, I dose to sleep twice, the film could have started with more actions. Otherwise great.",1
5.0,It kept my attention and it was a beautiful story,1
5.0,As a returning fan I was glued from beginning to end. Felt like I lived a whole life with them!,1
4.5,The movie was really good well first 2 hrs was my 7yo got a tummy ache‚Ä¶,1
5.0,"It is very beautiful movie and fun, amazing view .",1
5.0,It was great! It was entertaining the entire movie! No dull moments.,1
3.5,The story lacked creativity. I didn‚Äôt lose myself in the movie like I did last time. It was still good acting and I liked the kid characters! I‚Äôm conflicted.,0
4.0,Loved the movie. Its too long,1
5.0,"Loved it all, would see it again.",1
5.0,The most amazing 3D ever!,1
4.5,Loved seeing it in 3D,1
5.0,"It kept me engaged, for the many hours! I did see it in 3D, its the only way to enjoy this movie.",1
3.0,The only thing i disliked is how the mean guy was saved after everything!. Agh,0
2.0,Having it i the water was cool but a terrible story liner,-1
4.0,My only issue with the film were the multiple time jumps and transitions early on,1
5.0,"Amazing production, special affects. Great story, very creative. Well done. What we expect from this film maker.",1
5.0,"A lot of great action, keeps you on the edge of your seat in suspense and really enjoyed the 3D picture.",1
2.0,"Way, way too long, too much pointless violence that was apparently just to fill screen time. Clear disappointment compared to first film. I enjoy ""shoot-em-ups"" as much as the next guy, but this film just took it to the point of monotony. Excellent graphics, that's not enough to carry a movie-did it actually have a script, or did they just make it up as they went along? A blemish on James Cameron's rep no matter how much it earns, just expected more. c",-1
3.5,It was overly long. They could have easily cut about 20 minutes from the movie or had an intemission at the 1.5 hour mark like they did years ago when I grew up in the 60s.,0
5.0,Liked the whole story line. Scenes were beautiful.,1
5.0,"We loved the story line, the 3D was wonderful, as in Avatar 1. We loved it especially because the same characters were in it. Great movie it was a must see for me.",1
5.0,Great storyline and the visuals are incredible!,1
4.0,Movie was incredible. Only lost a star because it was a bit too long.,1
5.0,It was wonderful my daughter loved the 3d effects,1
5.0,Amazing movie! Loved it and Ill see it again!,1
5.0,Movie definitely worth the 3 hours. Absolutely amazing & would rewatch over and over.,1
5.0,"Awesome Movie! 5 Stars, better than the 1st.",1
5.0,"Lived up to my expectations, then exceeded them! Great storytelling again, and stunning visuals",1
5.0,10/10 would watch again loved the quality I just absolutely love Avatar it‚Äôs a fantastic movie hopefully they make a 3rd one.,1
5.0,Movie was entertaining from beginning to end Also emotionally pleasing and family oriented Cant wait for the next installments to come,1
3.0,"Great visual movie with amazing animation, cg and vfx it flowed seemingly. All is lost with this soldier vs soldier story line, which obviously we are going to carry over to the next movie...weak",0
5.0,Loved it! I was not a huge fan of the first avatar. It did not hold my attention and I never made it through it. My grand daughter wanted to see this one so I took her thinking this was going to be the the longest 3 hours of my life. To my absolute surprise this one held my attention for the entire three hours and had me sad it was over. Wanted it to be longer.,1
5.0,"A beautiful movie, well done. entertaining",1
5.0,Everyone I knew said it was wonderful. I definitely agree. We both really enjoyed it.,1
2.5,It was good but long.,-1
5.0,"Excellent story, action oriented, and insufferably long.",1
4.0,Special effects were amazing. Loved the continuation that we are all interconnected and must find a way to all live together or we will all perish for hatred and violence.,1
5.0,"I loved the cinematography! The 3D was phenomenal. There were a couple of coming attractions that were in 3D and it simply adds excitement to a movie before the acting, etc. begin. The story was absorbing and kept me engaged from the beginning to the end. Bravo!",1
5.0,Good story and action. Great cinematography.,1
4.0,I was glad to see the story line continued but there than the setting the plot was much like the first,1
5.0,"Fabulous special effects, great story line. James Cameron is a genius. Cant wait for the next one!",1
4.0,"Good-Incredible scenery, adventure, settings, and final battle scene. Bad-Too much character setup and the plot moved slowly and was confusing at times.",1
5.0,Many improvements over the first while adding great character deep dives and fantastic action.,1
5.0,I liked everything about the movie. It is an amazing production. The underwater scenes were beautiful. The 3 plus hours went quickly .,1
0.5,We missed the movie because my mother had diarrhea.,-1
4.0,Very entertaining. Beautiful animation.,1
5.0,Very good. Great in 3D.,1
5.0,Amazing‚Äî beautiful‚Äî did not feel like 3 hours and still wanted more of wonderland settled and at peace in the end love this movie ‚Äî best Ive seen in awhile,1
4.0,The movie was great but it was a little long in the tooth in the middle. And there was a few unanswered questions. The action part of the movie was fantastic especially in 3D.,1
4.0,"Amazing, incredible-made-credible visual artistry, animation, 3D, creative imagining and rendering of jungle and sea flora and fauna. Gorgeous live action/cga mix, the cliffhanger ending positioning the story for a possible sequel more (?) to come?? The storyline was predictable, yet nicely done. There were missed opportunities for deeper character development that mark the best in cinema.",1
5.0,"This was one of the best movies Ive ever seen, and Ive seen a lot of movies. Avatar was much better in 3D so if you ever go and see it, I definitely recommend seeing it in 3D. It was a very heartfelt yet intense movie. Its a great movie to go and see with your family. If youre ever debating what to see at the movies. I highly recommend Avatar: The Way Of The Water",1
5.0,It was great enjoyed it throughtly,1
5.0,We loved this movie best one to see in3 d our second time seeing the movie loved it,1
4.0,"Liked the visual effects. Too long, got a little boring!",1
5.0,"Movies are meant to be entertaining as well as an escape. This movie has both. The graphics are so very impressive. Absolutely gorgeous. I didnt want to go see it because I thought the first one was enough, but I was so wrong. As long as the movie was, it was NOT too long.",1
3.0,Way too long. Visuals of course were great.,0
5.0,Movie was amazinggggg!! Watching it on 3D was so cool.,1
5.0,Spectacular visual effects and acting,1
5.0,The story line visually stunning,1
5.0,"Very entertaining! Made me happy, sad, mad, covered all the emotions.",1
5.0,I loved all the beautiful scenic focuses. The avatar movie was stunning with forest life. But with aquatic life was a beautiful refreshing take on their lifestyle differences,1
4.0,"Great entertainment, well worth 3 and something hours. This alien world is so immersive and beautiful you want to stay there and play in the water with the creatures. All the emotional touch points were properly touched, the acting of the avatars is amazing, at times seeming to be much better than real humans. Digital engineering at its best!",1
3.0,"Cinematography was breathtaking! Story line was just ok. Character development was better in the first movie‚ÄîI cared about the characters and what happened to them. This movie I didnt care what happened as much because my connection to the characters, especially the new ones, was lacking. Plus the plot was not great, very disjointed.",0
5.0,A terrific movie. Loved it. Hope theres another down the road.,1
5.0,So good & so many feels. Cried & laughed. Great action!,1
5.0,Amazing! We love it!,1
5.0,"I loved everything. Even the parts I hated, I loved. You cant make a believable bad guy without giving them agency to be evil. And so theres a pay off when the protagonists finally(!) decide to fight. Once again, I wanted to go to Pandora for real. Its beautiful. But so is the Earth. We should preserve it. Message received Mr Cameron.",1
4.5,I just hope that it doesn't take so long for the sequel.,1
4.0,"The story of the whale gave a wrap around hug of sensitivity. I was expecting more luminescence. The story was pretty predictable, yet, well done.",1
2.5,"The videography and CGI is great, but tired storyline is lazy writing with the same villains and the same storyline. I wanted to set it in 3D but at some point it doesn‚Äôt matter.",-1
5.0,It was such an amazingly made movie. My daughter and I laughed and cried. Pulls on your heart strings some but we throughly loved it.,1
5.0,"Exciting, non stop action. The time flies by!",1
4.5,"This movie was really good! Had a fun time watching it , didnt drag too much for a 3+ hour movie",1
5.0,"My parents had told me they loved it and it was beautiful, I had bought them surprise tickets to enjoy having a night out so this is what they thought about it.",1
5.0,"Maybe not as good as the first, but still awesome.",1
5.0,The 3D Story over all !,1
3.5,like too many other sequels that just rehash the original movie,0
2.0,Hard to identify with animated characters. The fight scenes never end...,-1
5.0,"Great movie, loved the water, very violent, entertaining 3 hours",1
2.0,"The 3D scenes were nice, but the first movie was much better. If we werent in the dream lounge seats then the 3 hour movie would have been not as enjoyable. It needed a better story line.",-1
2.0,"For such a long movie, little was done to explain whats actually going on. It was all a personal vendetta between Jake Sully and the clone of the deceased military sergeant. No real depth. I just didnt really care about anything going on. The whole movie played off the success of the first movie, but failed miserably this time around. There was so much emphasis on futuristic war and was loud and obnoxious. The visual display was pretty good, however, Ive seen just as good in video games.",-1
4.5,Best movie I‚Äôve seen in a long time!,1
5.0,"Great visual effects, definitely should view with 3D to get maximum effect. Clearly the middle movie in a trilogy, looking forward to the conclusive episode.",1
5.0,"The story line, the relationships, the characters & their bond with nature, their values & morals, the scenery - especially in 3D, the special effects, the creativity ... ALL FANTASTIC! I was captivated!",1
5.0,It was great graphics. It teaches you how to be more with the planet earth in the nature. Teaches you how to be with the animals. Love it.,1
4.0,Avatar 2 was way better in 3D than normal. The problem is with the story line. How did they bring that major and his men back to life and even in the blue suits? Also how come they got rid of the coffin where the solders had to be in order to be an Avatar? Looks like the story line will continue in Avatar 3 as the major seems to have nine lives. Story line is predictable and boring.,1
4.0,I liked the action. The cinematography was excellent. It was a little too long.,1
2.0,It was way too long and extremely boring.,-1
5.0,"Beautiful storyline of family, loyalty and adventure underwater with an enormous appreciation for sea mammals and sea life. Enjoyed",1
2.5,"The visuals were stunning, and the storyline was slow and a bit too long.",-1
5.0,Good movie. Amazing graphics. just like the first one.,1
5.0,"This was a very long wait for a sequel, but have to say it was worth all the years. Better than the first. Same plot basics, but with new twists and characters. Incredible graphics as expected, a whole other world within the world of Pandora. Unknowingly I bought tickets to the 3D, but was amazing and glad we saw it in that format. Was hoping for a post credits scene, but they didn't have one. 3 hours flee by we didn't even notice the length because it was that immersive. Highly recommend if you loved the first Avatar.",1
3.5,"theme was good, not as good as the first one. the bad thing was the picture was not very clear unless you were seeing the faces and pictures up close!!",0

4.0,"Storyline followed the first Avatar approximately 15 to 20 years into the future. Guy has 3 children that are truly the stars in this film. Good vs evil is the genre. Many same characters reappear in the same version but with a twist. Excellent special effects, high action, exciting scenes. A very long movie but the time flew by. In the end, you know there must be a sequel to follow.",1
3.0,"Way to long. It is really about the visual effects, if you take that away then it's just a average movie. It being so long I got bored at times in the movie theater.",0

5.0,That was one very long movie. But so well done. Loved it.,1
4.0,"Personally don't think watching in 3d is worth it. There's too many instances where things are blurry that I'd rather see clearly. I understand that they are giving things the effect of being further or closer away. As far as the movie, it was definitely very good, I did feel the storyline tended to wonder around a bit and make things a little bit harder to follow",1

5.0,I loved everything about this movie,1
5.0,"I actually thought the second Avatar, The Way of Water was better than the original. The scenes were breathtaking, and the plot was similar, but there was a lot more action in The Way of Water. Many of the same actors who were in Avatar returned to do the sequel and gave great performances.",1

5.0,One of the best movies of the year stunning and beautiful and emotional,1
5.0,"Great movie overall. Loved the story, the visuals and the acting.",1
4.0,"Late review so, if you haven't seen it by now, you likely won't, but you will be missing out. I have a simple criteria for rating movies, can you see the money spent on the screen? In this case, you surely can. Yes, it is very long, but it would be a shame not to meander through some of the most breathtaking CGI made to date. If you are going to go big, then go crazy big. This movie (somewhat like its predecessor) needs to be seen on the biggest screen to get the full experience. Is the plot a bit rehashed? Yes, but there is just enough new stuff that it clears the originality bar (even if just by a little bit). Perfect? No, but you can see the money spent on the screen and you can have a good time if you invest the attention span.",1

5.0,This second in Avatar series did not disappoint. Definitely worth seeing on the big screen in 3D.,1
5.0,Grandkids and I loved it! Long movie but worth it!!,1
0.5,Three hours of my life that I will never get back. No story. Blowing up sea creatures with babies does not a story make!! So displeased that I spent a penny to go into Mr. Camerons coffers! Pee you!!,-1

5.0,Great show. Awesome effects. Loved it,1
5.0,Awesome movie with wonderful artistic use of 3D technology adding to a deeper flavor of spiritual theme,1
5.0,"Pros: The movie is about family and the community that embraces Jake Sully after he makes a life among the Navi people. He is family man and has 4 children, 2 boys and 2 girls. The familial bond is strong. He also has a Hanai son, Spider, who wants to be Navi instead of human. Cons: I don't care for the senseless violence (killings) of people and sea creatures. It continues to show how the Sky people (humans) think that they are superior to other races. Still a good date movie.",1
5.0,Story and special effects. Al,1
5.0,I want to see avatar 3 now!. Avatar 2 is better then the first Avatar movie.,1

5.0,Thought it was amazing start to finish. Rates right there with Terminator 2 as best sequels ever.,1
2.0,"Just . It was more of the same, did we really have to wait a decade for a repeat with a different element? Count me out of the next two, just not worth the time or money.",-1
4.0,The special effects were fantastic and the story was very engaging. Loved the water scene.,1
5.0,It was thrilling from the start. It reminded me of my childhood somewhat. I did not do the violence.,1
5.0,A long awaited continuation of one of my favorite franchises. It gives a fresh perspective of the impact the RDA has on Pandora and also the lives of the Navi. The family dynamic of the Sulleys is a nice touch as it shows how a family may be raised during a time of war. Once again the RDA as a whole shows impressive technology and their increased need to find another home for the people of Earth will surely bolster their aggression going forward. This movie is definitely the stepping stone needed after 13 years to continue the story weve been waiting to see unfold.,1
5.0,I think this was the sixth time weve seen Avatar: The Way of Water. That tells you a bit about the movie right there. You immediately connect with the story and the characters. The cinematography is amazing. See it in 3D.,1
2.0,"3 1/2 hours of blue aliens swimming in clear blue water then soaring into the blue sky, Too Blue, Too Long. A rehash of Avatar + a little Titanic + a little Abyss + a little Aliens. PLEASE NO MORE!!! Greed!",-1
5.0,Was very entertained something always going on.,1
5.0,Disliked the people behind us playing their iPad for aloud for their small children during the movie. Small children should not be in an R rated movie.,1
2.5,Visuals are too good but Movie is too slow and dragging for 3 hours. 2 hours would have been enough.,-1

5.0,better than the first movie,1

5.0,Great movie. Better then the first one.,1
1.0,"I loved the new people and the lessons imparted. the acting was superb and emotionally moving an many different levels.

5.0,Good story and excellent special effects,1
1.0,"The theater showed the movie completely out of focus, we were forced to watch the 3D movie without the glasses to be able to see the movie at all. Now, this movie is ruined for us. We were refunded out ticket price but not your fee.. . Probably wont be back to your ticket site.",-1

4.0,Daughter liked it and it had a nice story of family.,1
4.5,Pretty darn good. Better than Avatar 1. Lovable complex characters. Easy to follow plot. Hits all kinds of emotions. 3D effects weren't too overwhelming but did make the experience better. Really cool mechs and believable futuristic imagery. I'd recommend everyone to go see it!,1

5.0,Extraordinary cinematography in 3D. The entire plot draws you into a magnificent climax. Gorgeous.,1
3.0,"Too long, pretty bad boring lengths in the middle, with no progress in the story. Technically impressive and well crafted, but it didn't blow my mind like other movies did. A good package in total, so worth watching if you like the brand. It also didn't feel like it was moving the world's story forward very much. Kinda like meh, similar to SW Episode 7.",0
5.0,"#AvatarTheWayOfWater will leave audiences hailing it an instant classic. Movie of the year praise just doesn‚Äôt do it justice, this is #MovieOfTheLife. Watch Count: 6",1

5.0,Special effects were awesome.,1
5.0,Unbelievable the quality of the production - especially in 3D. Long movie but was kept entertained throughout. Well done!,1
5.0,"I think some people having trouble connecting with the characters as there are many with difficult to recognize names but you do get a sense of who most of the important characters are, where they fit in the story and I don't think it hurts this storyline too much as there are at least three more installments. So don't expect to get everything all at once.. As It Seems our culture is all about instant gratification these days. Sorry, you're going to have to wait for a more complete saga.. not 14 yrs though.. & while this does round off fairly neatly as a sequel to the first Avatar, being a Powerhouse of audio and visual feasts throughout. It's definitely set up for even more interesting immersive feature scapes to dive into or sore through the Hallelujah mountains.",1
5.0,Great special effects!,1

5.0,An amazing movie loved it,1
3.5,"It was too long. There were definitely too many instances of it feeling like an episode of National Geographic, but it was definitely visually impressive. You can also feel the foreshadowing for the future installments based on how many stories he shoehorned it so it felt a bit unfocused even though they brought a lot of it together in end.",0
5.0,Amazing movie!! Worth the 3+ hours!! Better than the first one!,1
3.0,Good graphics. so-so story line. way too much violence for my taste,0
0.5,I thought it would be about fun under the water. Instead it was all about war. It went against my Christian beliefs also. I wished I hadn't seen it.,-1

5.0,I was mesmerized all over again amazing as the first Avatar!,1
0.5,The theater was broken. No idea how the movie was. Sat for an hour and half before they apologized and let us know the film would be happening.,-1
5.0,My husband and I both really enjoyed the action and the interaction between those in the film. Liked that profanity was minimal - violence presented tastefully and not blood and guts everywhere. Glad we went!,1

5.0,The3D effects were absolutely beautiful!!!,1

5.0,Beautiful people. A little too much violence and noise. No Marine I know would be so vindictive.,1
3.5,3D effects were great! The movie focus is heavy on armed conflict which is not our preference. We would have enjoyed more development of the transition between the first movie.,0
5.0,I loved it. Avatar is a 100% perfect movie already but AWOTW was a big part in this 100% perfect movie. I cant wait til the rest of the movies come out bc this was a 10/10.,1
5.0,Love it! Animation & storyline was excellent,1
2.0,"BAD, BAD COLOR - COULD HAVE BEEN A PODCAST VISUALS: I don't know if it was the movie, the 3D version or the theater equipment, but the color was bland and de-saturated. Most of the time it was just shades of blue-grey. There were no vivid colors. The darkness of the 3D glasses made it worse. In fact, I put the glasses on the end of my nose so I could look over the top of them during the scenes that didn't have much 3D effect. That did not help the colors other than they weren't quite as dark. It was very disappointing! I expected it to be beautiful and rich as I remembered it on the first movie. STORY: I enjoyed the story. It seemed to fit as a ""what happened as time passed"". BUT, a huge portion of the storyline involves the Avatar lifestyle. The poor quality of the colors severely undermined that.",-1
5.0,"I was not a big fan of the first Avatar, so I only saw this movie because it was my nephews birthday. I am happy to say I was pleasantly surprised. This movie hit much better than the first one. So, if like me you didnt find the first one as appealing, give the second one a chance.",1
4.0,Very good movie. Nice ocean creatures. However your Own Snacks and drink prices are ridiculously outrageous!! A combo drink and popcorn over 11 dollars is absolutely SICK !! You make more money with reasonable prices than Highway robbery!!,1
5.0,awesome! had my wife crying.,1
4.5,2 hours should be max time for any movie,1
5.0,Great special effects! As always James Cameron is a master! We loved the movie!,1
5.0,"Perfect movie to see it in movie theater in 3D. It is a great and very exciting movie, but for 3 hours and half duration, I wish we had at least a 15 minutes pause in the middle.",1
5.0,The graphics & the storyline are just amazing! I loved everything about the movie! I can't wait for the next Avatar!,1
5.0,"A highly anticipated movie - Avatar has become one of the most recognized stories and franchises deeply embedded in popular culture and knowledge - yet it still could deliver freshness an awe, it is still able to amaze at a level no other movies I know of are. When my wife suggested we go see ""Avatar: The Way of Water"", I wasn't sure if I am ready to until almost midnight on an unusually cold and windy night, but every minute of it was worth it. I am still unsure if the idea of bringing back Quaritich was a good idea (as opposed to creating a younger, different antagonist) - I guess a combination of how well Lang's performance in the original Avatar movie and perhaps lack of better ideas - but that really is the only somewhat questionable part to me - as overall I didn't find the plot as weak as critics note - and interestingly the extreme length was also totally bearable, even enjoyable. In summary, I can see why this movie is sitting as the 3rd highest box office grossing movie of all time.",1
5.0,Loved this movie it had everything. Must see on big screen,1

5.0,Action packed. Special effects are amazing.,1
3.5,"I loved, loved, loved the first Avatar movie, and so I looked forward to the sequel. I did enjoy seeing ""The Way of Water"" in 3D. The underwater scenes are interesting, and the Navi are way cool, but since we are already familiar with them and their culture, and this sequel was a little top-heavy in fight scenes, I cannot give it a full five stars. Still, the character development is appealing and the Navi connection with nature and The Ancestors is always compelling.",0
5.0,Amazing. Just as good if not better than the first one. They've done it again!,1
5.0,Awesome place. Loved it all. So realistic.,1
4.0,Enjoyed IMAX movie but sound a bit too loud.,1
2.0,"Dear James Cameron, did anyone ask for this? I watched this one because I'm trying to see all of the Oscar-nominated films, but seriously, did we really need another Avatar movie? And how self-indulgent does James Cameron have to be to think this movie needed a runtime of over 3 hours. This film was in serious need of an editor.",-1
5.0,Great special effects.,1
5.0,Movie was excellent although I felt angered at the destruction and unsolicited invasion.,1

The references to other movies were just wonderful and wonderfully underdone. I saw Disney's Pinocchio, deLaurentis's Dune, Poseidon Adventure, Star Wars, Moby Dick ... I'm sure I missed some.",1
5.0,"Parking for the facility was a bit confusing, however parking staff were readily available to provide clarity. Excellent movie, great graphics, and great storyline. Staff inside the theatre were welcoming and well informed. We were disappointed that the seats didnt recline. Overall, a great experience for my twins first 3D movie. Thank you everyone!",1
5.0,"Wonderful, exciting, beautiful movie!",1
3.5,The special effects were great. What this movie suffered from was a badly written script with overused dialogues from 20 years ago and the movies length.,0
3.5,"Spectacular special effects and almost constant insistent brassy music essentially upstage everything else. In this particular theater, there was a full half-hour of previews in which the sound was stoked WAY WAY up. Painful. Considering there were no more than 30 people in a 500+ seat theater, it was simply inconsiderate to have the sound cranked up that high. The war scenes were almost interminable. It my estimation, they were TOO much. I DID like much of the film, but much of my time in the theater was spent admiring the special effects and wondering how they were achieved, rather than being compelled by things like theme, plot and character.",0

0.5,"Ridiculous movie that ruined a well developed character by devolving him to his worst self and showing that he was evil in nearly all universes. Story was insultingly bad, unlikable characters with no redeeming qualities.",-1
3.0,seemed a bit boring compared to the others. cast didnt seem to bring the same energy as other marvel or even doctor strange titles,0
3.0,Decent action film that wastes its universe traveling concept.,0
4.0,a good installment to the mcu. Lots to try to keep track of but bright things together well.,1
2.0,I really didn't buy into Wanda being a villain even after seeing Wandavision.,-1
5.0,One of my favorite Marvel movies!!!,1
3.0,"The movie was confusing, so much happening at once, nearly fell asleep. That said, it was still entertaining",0
3.5,I didn't like how they made Wonda the bad guy.,0
4.0,doctor strange rocks! this movie started off with action and didn't disappoint. seeing Wanda embrace the villain role was amazing! it was a great addition to phase 4,1
5.0,love Dr. strange! I'm extremely bias,1
2.0,"Entertaining in some aspects, but mostly a huge mess of a movie.",-1
3.5,"Good movie, though Elizabeth Olson could stand to take some acting lessons and work on her attempt at an accent. Her performances in the MCU make me roll my eyes. Regardless, Sam Raimi's directing saves this film in the long run.",0
2.5,Elizabeth Olsen was amazing. that's about it.,-1
1.5,A concept I enjoyed but a delivery I felt was very basic.,-1
4.0,Loved the zombie scene. Didn't really like the CGI,1
2.0,"was definitely something to look at for two hours. stakes were established and entirely forgotten about by the end of the movie. there was a whole lot of gratuitous gore, which never amounted to anything other than shock value and was also forgotten about by the end. america was more of a cardboard cutout than a character. wanda's corruption arc happened entirely offscreen which was definitely a choice to make. of all the movies this is one of them. it was a terrible decision to release this right after everything everywhere all at once.",-1
4.5,"I love Marvel, and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is one of my favorite Marvel movies of all times. Regardless, my biggest complaint is that America C.'s character was very weak, annoying, and somewhat cringe.",1
4.0,"This will probably be the last good Marvel movie. Better than I expected, but to many things spoiled before it came out. my original review didn't go through, so just make it short and sweet... Definitely not looking forward to any other marvel movies or series after Thor and Guardians 3...",1
0.5,The smartest man in the universe spilt apart like a shredder. Enough said.,-1
1.0,"Another meh MsheU movie. Musical fight was the cringiest thing ever, ending was dumb too. whole plot just begs the question constantly 'why?'",-1
2.0,disappointing didn't love up the hype and expectation,-1
2.0,Marvel has become a spectacle devoid of core stories. Too many elements and too short time to explore the characters made this movie a soulless adventure and became boring pretty quickly. Every other movie these days have dazzling VFX. It has lost its appeal from the Avengers days. Marvel should invest heavily in stories instead.,-1
4.0,"If you didn't have the chance to see it in theaters I would suggest watching it at home. While it may not be the strongest installment in the Doctor Strange saga it does draw nostalgia from the multiple appearances of fan favorites including honoring a casting that most marvel fans have been yearning to see. Elizabeth killed it in this film, and while I did enjoy every scene she was in, this felt more like a Scarlet Witch film than it did a Strange film. But I must say, with it's lows it has highs. And I would deff watch again!",1
4.0,"There could have been a little bit more madness to this multiverse but Sam Raimi‚Äôs direction makes this a unique and thrilling addition to the MCU. With great visual effects and excellent performances, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is an outstanding cinematic experience.",1
5.0,"This is like the 5th time that I watch the movie but the first one in a proper Cinema, it‚Äôs an excellent movie, even there‚Äôs few things that could be better, anyways it‚Äôs one of my favorite movies ever. The excellence of the Elizabeth Olsen acting is on a whole new level. It‚Äôs 9.2/10 just because of HER!",1
3.5,"if was a good Marvel movie. Special effects aside, the story picks up where WandaVision, Loki, What If?, and Spider-Man No Way Home left off. The multiverse is vast with many, many, many versions of everyone, except for one unique teenager who is introduced in this movie. She is the basis of this movie and her interactions with Strange is what carries this show as well as the convictions of Wanda. There's fan service teasing what could be with a world being run by a group of super-powered individuals calling themselves the Illuminati. Again, watching the aforementioned shows on Disney+, will help to build a good foundation of what you can expect in watching this second installment of Doctor Strange.",0
5.0,fantastic wild ride of a storyline,1
5.0,"If you are a fan of Sam Raimi and Marvel, this movie is a love letter to you. It has all the Raimi-isms sprinkled throughout and only intensified my love for Wanda. Love love loved this.",1
5.0,Another great Marvel movie.,1
5.0,"Awesome movie, would definitely go see it again.",1
2.0,"Very cheesy at many points in the movie, making it highly un-enjoyable. Didn't like the point where the viewer needs to have seen the show in order to fully comprehend the back story, and many plot points made no sense and hurt the viewing experience.",-1
4.0,very good. convoluted storyline but that's why we like them.,1
5.0,"Different but enjoyable. Was not quite the same feel as previous films, but I could get past it. A little more violent than some other MSU films.",1
5.0,Great action and suspense,1
3.0,"The concept was interesting, but the execution I feel was lacking a bit. The dialogue/script was a bit corny at times as well. Still, it was entertaining.",0
4.0,"It's Dr. Strange, it is going to be weird! It could have been much better though. The story line was very interesting as it went off in a direction I was not expecting with the multiverse. A comic book expert had to fill me in. Go see for yourself!",1
3.5,"it was a good movie, but it certainly had some missed opportunities, what really was my only meh about the movie was not involving a more fulfilling back story with the characters that are in the movie.",0
5.0,it was awesome loved the movie.,1
5.0,Wonderful movie! Well thought out movie!,1
5.0,It was great but if you get scared a lot then i would not recommend this to you.,1
5.0,Great film! Loved how it tied into the What If? series. Acting was wonderful and the movie kept me engaged the entire time.,1
5.0,One of the best looking MCU movies to date.,1
1.0,This movie had a lot of graphics and was jam packed with adventure it was too long ai think much of this plot could‚Äôve been done and over in 1.5 hours and the alternative lifestyle didn‚Äôt exactly meet likings,-1
5.0,it was a great and mind blowing movie,1
5.0,Truly one of the best movies of the MCU yet.,1
4.0,"Bit disappointed that there was no connection to Spider-Man, also really dark.",1
4.5,it was very intense movie very different than the rest I took my (9yo) brother and he was a bit scared not going to lie I was to it was creepy but cool didn't expect it.,1
4.0,i liked the mental agility to keep up and the special effects. over all good movie.,1
4.5,Standard marvel madness,1
5.0,Great special effects & story line.,1
5.0,"Starts off with an exciting sequence! It took me a while to figure out who some of the Marvel characters were, but that's my problem. I miss the Stan Lee cameos. Entertaining, and be sure to sit through the end credits.",1
4.0,Not much of a story line. Writers must have been on acid.,1
5.0,So awesome excellent movie,1
4.0,This movie is bananas. Watch it. Just watch it.,1
5.0,Movie is entertaining will recommend to F&F!! Im a comic fan & for once nailed the main character,1
3.5,Liked the hero cameos for the Illuminati. The end credit scene was extremely disappointing,0
3.5,"From the Marvel Cinematic Universe, comes its 28th feature within its film series, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. This film has the heartstring of fresh new life from a well established director of superhero flicks, Sam Raimi. The direction he brings come in the form of a strong cinematic look to contrast from the grayish cinematography from previous entries. Horror elements may be lacking in shock, but leaves potential with appearance and effect to raise the stakes. Most of action is competent when the visual effects are showcased with every other character‚Äôs power ability. The film does however lets down its audience member‚Äôs expectations of meeting new heroes in the franchise with quick ease. Though, the horror intensifies with each downfall presenting a threatening presence. Seeing the second entry in Doctor Strange‚Äôs storyline will be a blast of some eeriness and wonder.",0
3.0,A Little to Heterophobic. Ratings need to start including how perverted the sun plots are!,0
5.0,Dr strange is the most interesting marvel character for me right now didnt hit like the usual at all,1
5.0,lots of action from beginning to end worth going to see. when the movie is over don't leave there is more before the credits,1
4.0,Another success in this franchise.,1
1.5,"Storyline was confusing AF with little to no character development. The villain was a mother who destroyed entire universes so she could stay with her made-up kids? I mean WTF?? Despite the horrific lack of a cohesive script, the acting by Benedict, Rachel and Elizabeth was off the charts and a site to behold as they delivered against an unfathomably confusing script.",-1
5.0,Fabulous movie! Cant wait for 3!,1
5.0,So many amazing parts on the edge of my seat! Loved this movie!,1
2.0,Felt like I was watching a Bollywood movie from the 80s with Salman Khan in it. All this cuz a woman wanted kids? She just couldn‚Äôt have gotten laid in her universe? And then at the end Strange turns into a White Walker from GOT! Couldn‚Äôt tell if I was watching a superhero movie or a horror flick.,-1
3.0,it was decent but was expecting more,0
1.0,"for it being that long, I didn't find it interesting enough to keep me intrigued. not at all.",-1
2.5,Honestly it was okay. Over the last 14 years I‚Äôve been drawn to the marvel movies because of how entertaining they are as well as the amazing quality of the movies‚Ä¶ it seems like after Wandavision came out they haven‚Äôt been up to their normal quality. The editing has been really cheesy and not as great and it just hasn‚Äôt been up to par. I still think an okay marvel movie is better than most good movies but I was still disappointed in this movie. The lead actress had a Disney channel style of acting if that makes sense. It was okay. I think overall I would give it 4.5 out of 10. It was a fine movie but I would never actively seek it out.,-1
4.5,The kids loved it too.,1
3.0,A little too strange,0
5.0,"Really good movie, ending was awesome",1
1.0,"way too dark and too much sorcery, just not for us.",-1
3.0,it was OK. kinda darker than expected. Storyline was a lot about Wanda (Wanda Vision),0
4.5,"Awesome visual effects, great story line.",1
4.5,Great movie but I liked the first movie better,1
0.5,They‚Äôve run out of ideas. This movie was terrible and not worth the money spent.,-1
5.0,The fact that was more an scary movie than an action movie,1
4.0,This was a fantastic movie to watch. I gave it four stars just because there was so much death. I took my nine year old. It kinda freaked him out. But as kids are so desensitized he really liked it. I loved the delicious way the movie did the cinematography. Make sure you go see it. you won't be disappointed. Enjoy,1
4.5,"Great action, surprising moments and more in depth moments regarding the main character!",1
2.0,Not sure if Covid messed with Marvel‚Äôs mojo but this one really missed the mark.,-1
3.0,I am too old to enjoy Marvel movies but my Granddaughter liked it!,0
5.0,Loved the twist that Wanda was the bad guy. Liked that the teenage girl represented diversity and she was likable.,1
5.0,This was a really fun movie to watch!!,1
5.0,Good story line. Kept me entertained. My one drawback is waiting for the double endings. Takes too long to get through all credits,1
4.0,it was a very long movie. lots of plot potential that didn't get met. Chavez was more of a plot hole rather than a character showing her powers,1
3.0,Lost interest. Although lots of action,0
5.0,We don‚Äôt think cursing adds one thing to any dialogue‚Ä¶ as a matter of fact it‚Äôs distracting and unnecessary.,1
5.0,"Love the cast, great special effects, had funny moments and edge of your seat moments.",1
5.0,Loved this movie!!! Fantastic movie!!!,1
5.0,Like the movie. Interesting how they tied all the universes together.,1
2.0,"Excellent special effects, odd story, though.",-1
3.5,Fun. Kind of feels like marvel just decided there are no rules though.,0
5.0,I have never seen the movie with beautiful vibrant colors it was my fantastic movie and I would wanna watch it again sometimes but now I have to go back and watch Doctor Strange one,1
2.0,"To dark, to loud and to many different stories. Hard to follow. Great special effects.",-1
5.0,"good, 10/10. recommended.",1
5.0,Excellent story line. Excellent cinematagraphy and the hang at the end was good. Disliked them going woke with one of the main characters having two mom's no dad,1
4.0,"Aside from it going all over the daggone place, we enjoyed it.",1
3.5,Good storyline and action throughout,0
1.5,This movie was a huge disappointment. The action was contrived and overdone. It had more to do with the Crimson Witch than Doctor Strange.,-1
2.5,"An interesting premise isn't fully realized in this film where the plot doesn't hold up to the logic test and the America Chavez character is used as a contrivance throughout. There is some cool action, but it's not enough. The horror elements are present but watered down by typical Marvel quips and forced levity. Worth a watch, but at home on Disney+ eventually.",-1
5.0,I traveled a couple multiverses,1
4.0,"Great action movie, even though it's a bit confusing. I'll be watching again for sure.",1
5.0,Great story line . If you follow each character carefully within movies and series you‚Äôll understand the movie. Characters kept anticipating my attention. It‚Äôs worth watching for two hours .,1
4.0,"It was great, just a little STRANGE!!!",1
4.0,So much fun!!! Looking forward to watching this epic play out!!!,1
5.0,Movie had great story-line. Great actors and actors lots of magic and drama..,1
5.0,"I really enjoyed the movie, which I felt was even better than the first Dr Strange. The cinematography was Exceptional! It was action packed to the end!",1
0.5,"Fell asleep, ending was pretty good tho.",-1
5.0,Another Incredible Marvel Adventure!!,1
4.0,"I'm not huge into the marvel universe so based on the previews for this movie I was worried I wouldn't have a clue what was going on because it looked way wild and out there. They did a great job with it, I was never lost and things were explained well in the movie.",1
4.5,Visually phenomenal (wish it was in 3D) great story for the Marvel MCU. No downtime or slow parts. Plenty of surprises.,1
3.0,good special effects but poor story,0
4.0,A little slow moving at times but I super enjoyed seeing a Sam Raimi version of MCU.,1
0.5,to confusing not into dr. strange,-1
4.5,I like the action packed all through the movie...,1
3.0,"Mid. Kind of a weak storyline, agenda filled movie pushing things down your throat (woke propaganda). I‚Äôd watch it just the once, but that‚Äôs about it. That aside, Elizabeth Olsen carried.",0
5.0,Always moving. You feel for the villain as much as you do its heroes.,1
4.5,Very entertaining with a lot of humor!,1
0.5,Honestly one of the worst Marvel movies of all time. Really liked the first Doctor Strange. This one is about Wanda wanting kids. Thats it. Thats the plot. Angry woman mad she doesnt have kids.,-1
5.0,This movie kept my attention and had great scenery and transitions. I could follow the storyline.,1
5.0,Totally awesome. Can't wait for the continuation. Enjoyed every bit of it.,1
4.0,the special effects were cool.,1
5.0,My husband and I enjoyed the movie. Father's Date movie date,1
5.0,"Just Plain FUN - exciting, funny, extreme, - Just Plain Fun",1
5.0,I lived everything about the movie,1
5.0,My family and I enjoyed this movie so much. Dr. Strange is one of our favorite Marvel characters. We also liked his previous supporting characters and the new ones as well. The plot and special effects kept us entertained the whole time.,1
5.0,"The special effects were out of this world and use of music near the end tripped me out. I loved this movie, saw it twice already.",1
0.5,Long. Boring. Dark. Cheesy,-1
5.0,On the edge from start to finish. Great FX!,1
4.5,"The dialog was a bit stagnant at times, but was overall fantastic!",1
1.0,"This new Raimi director sucks. HE HAS RUINED OUR TRADITION OF MARVEL MOVIES. Gory, horror, dark, demon references, my girls do not want to watch another MARVEL movie to say the least. As it has been since 2008 me and my daughters have been watching them all. This one left a very bad feeling after walking out of the movie.",-1
4.0,"Confused to as which universe this took place, but a great movie",1
2.0,"This was a sludgy movie - choppy, slow and disjointed. The character of America Sanchez was poorly written out, I had very little empathy for her. This movie felt like a part two of Wandavision and started off strong with Scarlet Witch's story but fell to the wayside when the storyline veered off into Strange's own emotional ""battle"". Poorly written for a couple of great actors (Cumberbatch and Olsen).",-1
5.0,loved everything about this! absolutely amazing,1
0.5,"It rates as the worst movie I've ever seen, just nonstop violence and killing without a real plot or character development. I fell asleep, it was so bad and the madness simply moved from portal to portal. If it's a multiverse, the least the writers could do is make it an interesting contrast of character, plot, and suspense. With such gratuitous violence, it's no wonder our world is evolving into a multiverse of madness. The only problem is we can't run through a portal and suddenly find ourselves unscathed.",-1
4.0,It was a fun movie with lots of great special effects definitely keeping with the doctor strange genre I would recommend it to anyone that likes the Marvel Universe seeing it on the big screen made it even that much more of a fun experience!,1
4.0,Movie was entertaining from start to finish.,1
5.0,"Im a fan of the series and I loved this addition! It was very engaging and suspenseful. There were great action scenes, an amazing storyline, and seeing the familiar faces of the characters Ive come to love made it all come together.",1
5.0,nice to see Marvel can still do a dark themed movie ... slight horror vibes was pretty impressed with it.,1
5.0,Absolutely incredible movie!! Entertaining from beginning to end!,1
4.0,"Plenty of action. A few good surprises, I don't want to spoil it for anyone. Great cast",1
3.5,Overall it was a good movie,0
5.0,Great movie. Action packed. Will not be disappointed,1
3.0,"The MCU is going downhill. This Doctor Strange movie is another example of how Marvel is losing it's ability to create captivating story lines, reaching for something interesting, creating compelling villains for the heroes individual movies, succumbing to Disney's ""wokeness"" and not realizing that they a history of amazing characters other 50-60 plus years that they continuously overlook. The are creating ""newer"" heroes that frankly have no compelling draw and are just there to somehow awaken us to the social injustice their parent company perpetuates and makes extremely obvious in their attempt. And with that, they have removed the ferocious, manly nature of many of their heroes and just made them vacuous and uninspiring (Thor, Hulk for example). I wanted to like this movie, especially due to the character Scarlet Witch, which is a character that Marvel has not oversimplified. But instead of creating an adequate villain, Marvel ""uncreatively"" takes a known hero and and turns them malevolent. This movie ranks up there with the later Tom Holland Spiderman movies... pure prosaicness. I'm sure the upcoming Thor movie will be no different. Thor, The Asguardian Stand Up Comedian (starring Disney woke agenda, playing themself).",0
5.0,We really enjoyed this movie. It was a great addition to the Marvel franchise and I look forward to seeing what comes next.,1
5.0,Very good special effects.,1
2.0,The auditorium was almost 80 degrees. Very uncomfortable. Couldn‚Äôt enjoy the movie,-1
4.0,I wish there was more but overall it was great marvel movie,1
5.0,Very good storyline. Kept me interested for the entire movie.,1
2.5,Poor story line. Very disappointing and I really like the Dr. Strange character.,-1
2.0,"Too complex of an idea, they didn't understand it enough to execute well.",-1
5.0,The recliner chairs were comfortable,1
5.0,"Very good movie! Had some horror elements, so if you're sensitive to zombies or jump scares, you may not like parts of it. But it's a very good plot, and I like how it's a continuation of Wanda's sorry arc from Wanna Vision, so it's helpful if you saw that. Also helpful if you saw Marvel's What If",1
5.0,I loved it all. No it wasn't rushed but you will be lost if you don't keep up with the MCU,1
5.0,Loved this movie even though there was some very funny parts loved it!,1
4.5,"Great movie, awesome story!",1
3.5,It's alittle confusing at times and I'm not really sure how it fits into the rest!,0
5.0,"loved the movie, seriously 10/10, heads up if you have little ones it can get a bit scary.",1
5.0,It was exciting Certainly not boring and made for the big screen. Finally a Hispanic Kid. Good to see that representation.,1
5.0,See it in 3D--you won't be disappointed!!,1
3.5,"It was decent. Of course, not on the level of Spider-Man and not so much character development but I was entertained. *Spoiler alert*** I‚Äôm glad I watched WandaVision so Scarlet Witch was no surprise.",0
5.0,I knew Wanda was dangerous from Wandavision but this made me love her even moreee ! Great movie !,1
4.0,"Great movie, but the final is not what I expected.",1
4.0,It was good but one of my least favorite Marvel movies. Dr. Strange always adds extra spice to a story line but felt the story moved a little slower than an average.,1
4.5,"Although different from your normal Marvel movie, I absolutely loved it. It was like Marvel meets light horror.",1
4.0,It was good but confusing at times and seemed to be more about Wanda than Dr Strange,1
5.0,Glad to see Marvel got back to its core after the Eternals & Five Rings movies. Dr Strange is a core Avenger and glad the movie was able to carry the mantle,1
5.0,I liked it even though it was dark. The ending was unexpected.,1
0.5,Like a B movie. No story. Ridiculous. You screwed up my favorite character. This is in Green Lantern territory.,-1
3.0,"thought it would have more visual rlem scenes. was more plot line, then action.",0
5.0,really good movie üëçüëç,1
4.5,"There‚Äôs a terrific scene that was simply musical, but not. Loved it!",1
5.0,really enjoyed the movie,1
5.0,Excellent Marvel movie which has you on the edge of your seat and hits you with surprising scenes you would not expect in a Marvel movie. terrifying in its own right and dramatic. Definitely worth its weight in gold.,1
5.0,"2nd time watching this movie in theaters, can't wait for it to come out on Disney+ to try and find more Easter eggs. a must watch.",1
5.0,Great story following Doctor Strange into the multiverse. Visually stunning graphics bring the story to life on the big screen.,1
5.0,Liked everything about it hope that make a sequel,1
0.5,"MCU please dont try to do horror. You are funny, not dark. If I want to see dark, Id go see a DC movie. It wasnt even really about Doctor Strange.",-1
5.0,So. Much. Fun!!!!! Great movie. Great escape. Cant wait to see it again,1
5.0,For fans of MCU absolutely it‚Äôs a must see. Loved it!,1

4.0,"Being a Marvel die-hard fan since I was a young girl (Im 69) who bought the comic books & watched all the Marvel movies, Ive been let down by all the spin offs since Infinity End Game with exceptionFalcon & Winter Soldier.",1
4.0,"it is good and the visuals are fantastic, but it didn't really bring anything new to the table.",1
5.0,I love Dr. Strange!!! This movie did not disappoint me in any way.,1
4.5,Love the movie So much excitement and special affects to the max,1
4.0,"It was sort of twisty and for another, it may have been kind of hard to follow especially if you haven't seen the whole Marvel catalog. I enjoyed it. I haven't really been doing movies since covid so it was a nice escape. Seems like summer blockbusters are back so excited to get out and participate.",1
5.0,Excellent movie and she was a beast and I loved all the new heroes!!!!!,1
3.0,weird ass scary ass movie,0
3.0,Im not a Marvel fan. My husband is,0

5.0,"AWESOME! so much going on but well done, exciting, easy to follow.",1
5.0,action from beginning to end,1
3.5,"Storyline had a weak plot weighed too heavily on theatrics. However, I would recommend Movie if you are a Marvel fan.",0
5.0,Great special effects!,1
3.0,"All in all it was good. However, to much seemed repetitive in the story. Time wise it could have been paired down.",0
5.0,My granddaughter and best friend had a blast the movie it was awesome a must see for sure,1
4.0,"Good action but drug on a bit. writing was kinda meh in several places. if you are a dyed in the wool MU fan, it's worth it no matter what!",1
4.5,I liked seeing different versions of Dr. Strange with somewhat varied personalities.,1
4.0,Solid Movie - stunned that it was out for weeks and still had surprises. 2 hours well spent,1
5.0,It was amazing!!! Sam Raimi is an amazing director and this film proves that yet again. The cast was fabulous and the fantastic effects were remarkable. Muat see!,1
5.0,great addition to marvel,1
5.0,The movie Doctor Strange was excellent we loved it and all the incredible details throughout the movie!!,1
2.0,Boring. Bad cast development. Who cares about America Chavez? What a lame character.,-1
5.0,"Loved it. Acting was top notch and it was such a Sam Raimi flick that it brought tears to my eyes. Well done Marvel, well done.",1
3.5,Entertaining. Great graphics.,0
5.0,Make sure you watch Wanda vision before you watch this movie. That being said this is probably the best marvel movie I've seen.,1
5.0,Amazing digital effects!,1
4.5,Loved it! Another Marval hit!!,1
2.0,It has the usual bombastic almost coninutoous blasts of power rays and floating people which by now I find incredibly boring. If you have seen on Marvlel movie you have seen them all.,-1
5.0,"I liked it a lot better than the first Dr Strange. Very good, a lot of great in jokes (and one glaring missed opportunity for a heck of a joke), and a solid storyline.",1
5.0,Awesome Just Awesome,1
3.0,"Started alright with good potential for the storyline but turned a bit ""hokey"" and ridiculous near the end. Too long I think the ridiculousness comes in when they try and add more than is really needed. Otherwise, it was an ""OK"" movie. There are better Marvel movies out there . . . but there are also worse.",0
2.5,"Super disapointed in the movie. I was SO excited about this movie. I love Doctor Strange and usually I just wait for movies to come out where I can stream them but this one I went to the theatres for. It was definitely below expectations and it pains me to only give it 3 stars. The story was a bit akward. I always feel like they try too hard to introduce a new character. I did love the idea of the multiverse and that some verses have Doctor sthat know about it and some that dont. I do like some of the consistency. I think the fight between the two Doctor Strange characters was weird and the musical note thing made no sense. It felt like it was lacking something. I feel like they added a bunch of stuff into the movie and strayed away a little from the fact that this movie was about Doctor Strange and they spent way too much time focusing on the other two main characters. I could continue on but in reality, sadly, the movie was just a bit lackluster. Sad to see. I am hoping that the next installment will be better.",-1
2.5,Not a satisfying chapter in the multiverse saga,-1
3.5,slow in spots but got better. liked it more as it went on.,0
3.0,expected more with such a wait for it and all. Barely 2 hours and what?,0
3.5,Pretty Legit. Not made for kids though. I really enjoyed a new take into the Marvel Horror area!,0
4.5,Totally enjoyed the 2nd installment of Dr. Strange. I believe it would have FANTASTIC had it been in 3D!,1
3.5,"Story development took a while, and requires a fair amount of inside knowledge from other shows, but the ending is solidly done",0
1.5,"Very hard to watch. Too many story lines to grasp . Sorry, not the best Marcel Movie",-1
4.0,I love the special effects when they used the music notes,1
4.0,Loved the ride. Had some problems with the acting of the kid who played America Chavez though. It was a fun watch!,1
3.5,"In terms of MCU movies, this lands somewhere towards the middle of the pack regarding a cohesive story. The plot itself is explained well enough, but the progression is pushed too quickly. The introduction of a new character allows for the ability to quickly move between universes, so in typical Marvel fashion, they have to tease what each universe could bring in the future. It just seems as if Marvel is beginning to stray away from a smoothly flowing plot in exchange for cameos and other easter egg appearances. Overall, the CGI, cinematography, and acting were all well executed. I just felt that it needed an identity of its own without pushing the forced cameo agenda.",0
5.0,I thought it was an amazing movie and an exceptional movie experience! Special effects were spectacular as with most Marvel movies. I will certainly be adding this to my collection in the near future.,1
4.0,Thought it was really good. Exciting. A lot of surprises. Was expecting a little more but wasn‚Äôt disappointed!,1
4.5,Movie was pretty good,1
4.5,"It's obvious that Marvel told Sam Raimi that he could go ham creatively and it really paid off. This was such a good movie, with a lot of interesting ideas that paid off really well. My only complaint is that Sam got a little too self indulgent by with the second stinger, which was kind of annoying. Otherwise, this is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen.",1
3.0,"Not the best Marvel film however, Elizabeth Olsen...stunning.",0
5.0,The main characters are females and not Dr. Strange. I was pleasantly surprised! I also did not personally see many previews of this movie so there were no spoilers to my enjoyment of the entire movie.,1
2.5,A good movie but to be honest a lot of it didn‚Äôt make sense and just confused me in the end. After watching the movie I had to watch a video that explained everything that happened in the movie because I was confused throughout the film. It also just didn‚Äôt seem right for Wanda to be the villain. She played the part of the villain very well for what she was given but it just felt off since we‚Äôve always seen her as a hero. It was a drastic drop in character from what seemed like a recovery story following WandaVision.,-1
2.0,"Zero plot after 1/3 into the movie. After that, all magic and stunts with no meaning other than to dazzle, apparently. Worst marvel movie.",-1
4.0,It was a great movie..,1
4.5,The story was ok but the effects made it.,1
5.0,movie was so good 10/10 can‚Äôt wait for the next one,1
1.5,The story line was just so bad.,-1
5.0,Action packed and full of mind blowing moments!,1
5.0,I liked everything!!! Sam Raimi really brought this to the next level.,1
3.5,"Great effects, well paced and sometimes funny. A little more of a story line and better banter would have made this movie awesome",0
5.0,Had me on the edge of my seat . Cinematography was AMAZING,1
1.0,absolute cringe Fest quote from Doctor Strange. you're going to have to do more than kill me to kill me this time,-1
3.0,The sets and effects were great - the script not so much. A lot didn't make sense. and the fight scenes seemed repetitious. It still kept my attention but wasn't one of the better Marvel movies.,0
5.0,"It was funny, suspenseful, and sad..",1
0.5,"Wanda was the ultimate Karen demanding something that wasnt hers, destroying everything in her path until she got what she wanted. Disgusting storyline. I wanted to see Dr Strange NOT WANDA!",-1
4.0,"It was a little dark , but pretty good",1
5.0,Can‚Äôt wait to see the next one!,1
5.0,"Liked Scarlet witch, but glad she lost.",1
3.0,It was way out there on the reality scale,0
2.5,"Jumped around too much,hard to follow",-1
4.5,Misleading title but very good,1
2.0,"Way too busy. Way too many awful performances from supporting and minor cast. Cumberbatch and Olsen were fine. In fact, Olsen's performance was excellent. Great CGI effects! Absurd final conflict/resolution between the two Red Witches--director's fault. (SPOILER ALERT!)The kids were so terrible feigning terror in this scene that it was largely unwatchable. In this scene, Raimi needed to deal with the kids' poor acting, but he did not. It was awful! (In fact, lots and lots and lots of terrible casting decisions of people who could not act. It was truly weird.) He should have had them accidentally harmed by the Red Witch of our universe and knocked out and or threatened in such a way that the Red Witch of their universe, saves her kids from the Red Witch of our universe--and this shocks our Red Witch into correct thinking. Or they should have spontaneously and reactively worked together to resolve the damage done by the Red Witch from our universe (which again forces her to stand down and take stock of her insanity and grow her character as Raimi had intended), which would have given more depth to the Red Witches of both universes. If I had known what I know now about this movie before seeing it, I would not have seen it.",-1
5.0,"Full of fantasy, and action. Story line was well executed",1
5.0,A lot a good scenes. Kept the interest of the kids,1
4.0,I can see why some said watch the What if and Wandavision first as these will let you in on a bit more of the premise! Especially if you dont see wandavision you may be lost! But this one is starting to bring back more of the Moral Human compass I have come to love about our hero stories!!! For what truly makes a hero is one who trusts in The right thing to do!,1
2.5,"The first Dr. Strange movie had better plot - this one felt very contrived with strange plot holes, hinging on Wanda's supposed inability to cope with her own personal losses. The new character (America Chavez) has potential, and Benedict Wong is always entertaining. I would like to see Dr. Strange's character develop more depth - this movie was a good start, but didn't quite deliver. Less special effects, and more opportunities for real acting, please!",-1
5.0,"It was a fun, trippy, action packed movie.",1
5.0,"Action packed movie, new twist ....enjoyed it.",1
4.0,"overall decent and fun, but seemed to lack a little of being truly Epic Marvel movie...",1
5.0,Enjoyable from beginning to the end!!,1
1.0,Walked out after 45 min. Can‚Äôt believe I wasted 45 min of my life watching that dribble,-1
5.0,"fun movie, great theater for seeing a movie.",1
5.0,"Forgot it was a horror film, but loved every aspect of it",1
4.0,"Excellent, over-the-top (as expected) VFX. The Elfman soundtrack was superb! Ludwig Van, Amadeus and even Johann Sebastion would have appreciated the orchestrations. The director and editor tread the thin line in presenting what ""general"" audiences want to see and what ""insiders"" could handle. I'm not sure of the exact target demographic but I am 70 and sat next to a tween. We both seemed to enjoy the same parts. She did have to explain a couple of multiverse / time-space line / quantum entanglement minutiae. She did a splendid job (age 13). Overall, a solid B+ for story, acting, costume and music.",1
5.0,Fun Marvel movie with plenty of Marvel canon tie-ins.,1
2.0,super fake no sense boring,-1

5.0,Amazing movie. My family and I love Marvel movies.,1
5.0,We want to see again!!!,1
5.0,It was a really good movie. True to Marvel themed movie.,1
4.5,This movie had great ideas providing humor and awesome graphics.,1
4.5,another great doctor strange movie,1
5.0,BEST MARVEL MOVIE YET ITS WANDAS MOVIE,1
4.0,It was very good movie.,1
5.0,One of the best Marvel movies!,1
5.0,loved the film. it was exactly what the MCU needed to show some more versatility in the story telling and more of the characters abilities,1
1.0,More horror story than Marvel action movie. Maybe this should have been released in October as it is very dark. I would not take young kids to see this movie,-1
0.5,Horrible - no idea why anyone likes it.,-1
4.0,The horror aspects were fun.,1
3.0,"It was okay. They obviously tried to tie you into the aftermath of Endgame, while also entertaining you the Dr. Strange way. Solid effort, but not a good follow up to me.",0
4.0,"Great effects,decent movie. Storyline was a little weak",1
1.5,Lazy writing. Visual vomit fest.,-1
5.0,"It was a little hard to follow at first, but after a while I got into it.",1
2.0,"boring, long, not worth it.",-1
2.0,At most two stars. Weak for marvel,-1
5.0,"It was different, but it had a lot of new characters and a lot of action to it. Really good!!",1
4.0,little slow at times and a few parts were a bit cheesy and low budget.,1
4.0,Pretty freaky film! Definitely felt like a Raimi film for sure and definitely the darkest inclusion in the MCU.,1
3.0,"I didnt like the storyline, too long and boring",0
3.5,Darker than I expected,0
5.0,"This was another great marvel film with awesome action, excellent acting, and an entertaining storyline throughout. I was excited to see some first time appearances from several new characters. The movie did a superb job of migrating the different universes together. I would highly recommend this movie to a marvel fan or to a non marvel fan. It's simply a good movie.",1
4.0,"Movie was good, it would have been better if you could hear the actors conversation. Music was clear and loud enough so not sure if it was editing or that it was in one of the lesser auditoriums of the theater.",1
4.0,"I liked it a lot. My pet-peave was when the characters hesitate to get away from trouble. For instance, Strange and the nurse he loved hesitated to go through a door when the bad one was close behind. That‚Äôs RIDICULOUS! I hate dramatic pauses! Way too many in this one!",1
4.0,Glad to see other Marvel characters being crossed over into other series.,1
1.0,Can I give it fewer stars somehow? This movie was just trying too hard from beginning to end. I don't like what they did with Wanda's story and there are just too many characters. it seems Disney and Marvel have chosen to try and interest people with the sheer multitude of characters and stories instead of just having interesting ones. skip this!,-1
1.0,It was terrible! Worst Marvel movie we have ever seen.,-1
5.0,i liked everything about this movie from beginning to end,1
5.0,Another amazing movie from Marvel!!!,1
4.0,"Thought it was good, kept my interest the whole time, but all that it brings into the story is the multi verse",1
3.0,"Felt more like a WandaVision sequel than a Dr. Strange sequel. America Chavez was cool, but overall just meh.",0
0.5,"Amazing special effects. Couldn't care less about the characters. When you make the villain the most sympathetic character, you've kinda missed the target.",-1
3.5,"Kind of dragged on, lots of fill ins.",0
5.0,really good marvel movie,1
4.0,"Lots of action, good special effects, story could better.",1
4.0,"Not marvels best but definitely enjoyed the ride with some great performances , good enought story and visuals that at times amazed and left me questioning if it needed more time",1
5.0,"I‚Äôm not a fan of Marvel, but I liked the plot and all that sht",1
3.0,My son fell asleep. It was good if you love marvel but but not one of the best.,0
4.5,"the dr strange movies are so cool, i‚Äôd recommend watching the wanda show first",1
5.0,"Fantastic Film, on the edge of my seat the whole ride!",1
2.0,"Too much action, not enough plot, character development and humor",-1
4.0,"Great movie for Marvel fans! Really cool special effects and plenty of action. Fun for my husband, my teens, and myself!",1
3.0,Slow and repetitive. Other Marvel movies have a better plot and are much more exciting.,0
5.0,The best movie ever,1
4.5,It was a very good movie for my grandson.,1
3.5,"So much humor! And really great use of the characters from earlier in the movie later in the movie! Surprise surprise. Special effects were top notch. I did not get bored or feel cheated by the plot one little bit. I prepared by watching the spiderman movies, the What If series, and WandaVision. (Also all marvel films but that is beside the point). Really prepped for the Multiverse storyline. Really really enjoyed it.",0
4.0,I was pleasantly surprised I really liked it. The only thing it was a little loud for this 73 yr. old Grandma. My Grandaughter loved it she was going home to watch the previous movie. We had a great time.,1
4.0,Interesting plot. Surprised and impressed that the trailers didn't give the plot away. Overall satisfied with the movie.,1
5.0,Everything you could love about a comic movie and a Sam Rami movie! There will never be a better Dr. Strange than Benedict Cumberbatch!!!,1
4.5,Great action from start to finish!,1
2.0,"Dr. Strange has always been my least favorite Marvel character, so I was hoping the special effects and villains who make up for that. Unfortunately the special effects were just so-so and repetitive, and Mads villainous character barely registered. He was more notable (and chilling) as Hannibal Lecter. This movie was really all about Wanda, but even her all-out destruction couldn't hold my interest.",-1
4.5,"I must admit, after watching this film the 2nd time, it was STILL AWESOME! But they're still flaws in some but not all. Benedict & Elizabeth did their thing tbh. The action scenes were incredible. The storyline was good. Can't wait to see what's next for Doctor Stephen Strange.",1
5.0,Loved the layers if meanings! The heart felt ideas made this movie along with the escapism!,1
5.0,Awesome movie. Thoroughly enjoyed it with fam.,1
5.0,Excelent movie every! Marvel every time amazes me with the whole history of super heroes,1
0.5,"By far thee most disappointing Marvel movie I‚Äôve ever watched, horrible plot and don‚Äôt even get me started about the acting??? I‚Äôm shook, I know it could have been SO MUCH BETTER.",-1
4.0,Very interesting take on the multiple universe.,1
2.0,plot was terrible. cgi wasn't all that great and you could easily tell the green screen background. on top of that Marcus had the bar closed for some event and didn't announce or show that it would be closed. witch assisted in ruining my movie experience....,-1
2.5,"We did not care for the plot details and character assassinations. Great CGI, but really too dark for our taste. Marvel really needs to get back to some solid story telling.",-1
5.0,Elizabeth showed up and owned!,1
5.0,Action packed. Great visual effects. Story-line made sense (for this type of movie).,1
2.0,"Benedict Cumberbatch is always good as Dr Strange. I also liked Elizabeth Olsen. Both fitting for their parts. Unfortunately, the movie is mayhem from start to finish. Filled with ""wokeness"" and affirmative action actors. They try to ride Cumberbatch's ""cloaktails"" to success. It doesn't work. Check on YouTube for the story where a woman at Disney laughed at placing progressive touches through all their content. This is clearly the sad result. Next up is Lightyear. I'll pass.",-1
4.0,it was crazy and interesting. not sure what i don't like about it.,1
0.5,Was a horrible movie. Way too demonic and no warning about it at all,-1
1.0,"I disliked it because I didn‚Äôt like it. First of all, the name of the girl sucked. America Chavez??? Really??? I also felt the acting of the kid boys and her to be a little EH. THANKS for butchering Wanda. BYE",-1
5.0,Great scenes and surprise throwback characters!,1
5.0,Action from start to finish,1
5.0,Sweet film if you've been keeping up with the DisneyPlus Series. Love the build up to something huge like they did with Thanos in the first saga. Can't wait to see it come together. And Patrick Stewart!!!,1
4.0,lots of action from the get go. Having never seen Wandavision I was a bit behind but enjoyed it nonetheless.,1
1.0,Boring and I had 2 hours of my life stolen.,-1
5.0,Great story you can watch even if your not sure where the other movies left off. Can't wait to see the next adventure.,1
5.0,"Outstanding visual effects. Fast paced and High action entertainment. It is not quite the ""Best Marvel Movie to date"" But it is pretty close, and I have only had the chance to watch it once -)",1
1.0,Terrible. Long. Incoherent.,-1
4.0,A little out there but cool none the less,1
5.0,"What a ride. Sam Raimi brings his quirky and dark stylings to the Multiverse, fleshing out existing characters and introducing fascinating new ones. Wanda‚Äôs arc is one of the most interesting in recent film.",1
5.0,Amazing movie! The coolest thing about it was that the main Character and I are both named America and we are both Hispanics ü´∂üèºüò±!,1
5.0,Amazing movie It was justice,1
5.0,I liked The Scarlet Witch she was so cool and better than Dr. Strange who is a fraud. America Chavez was cool too and I like Wong as Sorcerer Supreme over fraudulent Stephen Strange. Also when Wanda killed the Illuminati it made me feel again.,1
5.0,Great action. Interesting use of other super heroes.,1
1.5,"some nice touches from Rami, and a couple fun cameos, but this was a too all over the place and a too long. whole sections were just unnecessary",-1
3.0,"This is more my husbands kind of movie. I never saw the ones before this one so I was lost in who was who. It was ok. But not great, to me.",0
4.0,I loved the visual effects. I did not care for the promotion of LGBTQ. Getting tired of them adding that into every movie these days. I have kids and they don't need to see or hear that stuff.,1
5.0,I‚Äôm not a marvel fan but went to spend time with family. I did watch first one so it helped me understand this one. I enjoyed it.,1
2.0,The main conflict is not particularly appealing. Neither my son nor I cared much for the America character to be concerned about her fate. Her survival just doesnt move the needle much. The fate of the universe (Thanos) or the world (Ultron) are things we can get behind. Some random kid without a compelling story did nothing to get us invested in her fate.,-1
3.0,It was ok as far as now a day marvel gets but plot is convoluted if your out of the story for long enough. I dont recommend kids come but do what you will.,0
4.0,This movie was good but I didn't understand the purpose of the last scene after the credits. Dr. Strange is cool but I'm sure how many additional movies they can make with his character before it becomes boring. I did enjoy seeing the guest appearances. Still and forever a Marvel fan.,1
0.5,I never saw the movie... I tried to exchange/refund my ticket before hand and your system wouldnt allow me to do so. Now Im outta 40... Thanks a lot.,-1
2.0,I wish I would have read more reviews prior to going and seeing this movie. I had avoided that because I did not want spoiler alerts. We did not care for this movie much at all. It was not at all in keeping with the theme of previous doctor strange movies. It did not even seem to be in the same MCU. It was more a horror movie than an entertaining action movie. The trailers for this movie are very misleading.,-1
1.0,Didn't get to see it and fandango won't refund me for a movie I couldn't see !!,-1
5.0,Great story line. Leaves alot to figure out what's next. Marvel never disappoints. I didnt like the 3rd eye thing but...its Marvel,1
5.0,One of the better Marvel movies I have watched for sure! I liked it a lot!,1
4.0,Was entertaining but really didn't move the franchise in any given direction.... Felt like a 3 parter.,1
4.0,Exciting great graphics,1
5.0,"Your mind will never be the same after this movie. If you think you know, just wait! This is a must see film.",1
5.0,"I like the cameos. I like the fact that their teams weren't introduced. But, it was good",1
5.0,"Good story line and lots of action. Also, you should expect the unexpected. Great movie!!",1
4.0,Seemed a bit forced but it was an ok movie,1
3.5,"The content was very good, but maybe just a bit too many fight scenes.",0
3.5,I liked the humor that was woven into the film.,0
5.0,Great movie would watch it again,1
5.0,Totally enthralled loved the Multiverse,1
5.0,very good story line. interesting introduction of the multiverse. great movie,1
0.5,One of the worst pointless movies I have ever seen. No redeeming aspects. Save your money,-1
1.0,"the movie went on and on, going into difefrent universes was very boring",-1
4.0,Really good movie. Enjoyed the plot. Multiverse always gives you different twists.,1
5.0,super dark. fantastic turns.,1
2.0,"Meh...I wanted to care about what was happening, but...",-1
5.0,"It was awesome, I hope Wanda is able to come back.",1
3.5,I went to this movie at the urging of my family although Im more of the Downton Abbey type of movie viewer. More enjoyable than I thought it would be but the volume in the theater was way too loud. We will wait for it to come to cable.,0
5.0,"The storyline, effects and of course, Benedict Cumberbatch. What else could you asked for or need?",1
1.5,movies just aren't what they used to be.,-1
3.5,"I like the story line,However it dident seem as real and captivating as the first one.",0
3.0,I felt like this was the story of the scarlet witch and doctor strange was just in it. 3 stars for visuals and being marvel,0
3.0,It was pretty good but not the best movie I've seen,0
5.0,The whole move had my whole attention will watch again,1
5.0,"Excellent movie! Concept, visuals, storyline ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.a most fantastic head rush!!!",1
2.5,"Since Disney took over, Marvels has gone down hill.",-1
3.5,MCU is getting off track man. They don‚Äôt make ‚Äòem like they used to.,0
4.0,"Obviously a must see if you're still following the MCU. Didn't like the elements of the Marvel shows from Disney + steaming coming into the movies. If you don't subscribe to the streaming service, its hard to know what's going on with that aspect of the plot. Otherwise a solid Marvel film.",1
5.0,man this movie is so hard. everything is good.,1
5.0,"If you like Doctor Strange, you will like this movie. Wanda was a pretty scary witch, too. I didnt like this as much as the first movie, but it was a good sequel.",1
5.0,o my god it was amazing,1
5.0,Great addition to the franchise.,1
4.5,Pretty good movie. We enjoyed it and will be looking forward to the upcoming movies from Marvel.,1
5.0,Wasn‚Äôt expecting that!,1
0.5,"Woke! Messages of communism and socialism within the multiverse. Promoting worlds where food is free, income isn‚Äôt necessary, fathers aren‚Äôt needed and strong messages of demonic sacrifice of children to be all powerful. The main character ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù was a daughter to two women/mothers before being exiled after the young girl suffers pain, which triggers the young girl to harness her abilities to travel to each ‚Äúmultiverse‚Äù. Dr. Strange must harness the darkness in order to save the young girl, leaving himself open to this ultimate reality.",-1
1.0,FIRST DR STRANGE 100 TIMES BETTER. WAY TO MUCH SPECIAL AFFECTS NO REAL STORY. IN MY OPINION.,-1

4.0,Good movie surprises all over the place,1
4.0,The 3 eyes creeped my son out.,1
5.0,everything was amazing!,1
0.5,"the storyline was terrible, it was more akin to a bad zombie movie than a marvel movie. extremely graphic and inappropriate for our kids. seriously disappointed.",-1
4.0,The visuals are amazing. The pace of the movie was all over the place. We still found it very entertaining.,1
2.5,Very bizarre! Definitely a kids movie!,-1
5.0,It‚Äôs good I saw it twice,1
5.0,Great action & characters!,1
0.5,Very slow. Storyline all over the place. one of the worst Marvel movies. Movie should have been called Wanda Vision in the Multiverse. Do not waste your money. Very very disappointing!,-1
1.5,Stupid story but good visuals. Poor casting with Elizabeth Olson. Someone like Charlize Theron or Angelina Jolie were more fit for this role.,-1
4.0,Liked the movie dont understand the ending,1
4.0,Black Panther was also apart of the Illumanti in the movie. He was absent.,1
3.5,Worth seeing as part of the MCU. A bit more scary than other MCU films for small kids. A bit more dark than Thor 2 at times.,0
5.0,its a great movie. a most see for all to see.,1
2.5,It was too disjointed and I didn't care about the characters.,-1
4.0,I think this movie broke my brain. It went from crazy to normal and back to crazy so quickly and so often that I feel like I need a nap to recover,1
4.5,"The movie was very entertaining, but it wasn't a cinematic masterpiece. Very glad I saw it in theaters.",1
4.0,We absolutely enjoyed it!,1
5.0,"Of the Marvel Comic Universe, I think Doctor Strange is my favorite series and character. That being said, I'm bias. I believe this was the best Strange movie thus far. It starts to pull in all of the Marvel comics via the multiverse. Great presentation and showing the humanity of Wanda under the facade of Scarlet Witch.",1
5.0,Had lots of action and just enough humor to keep it light.,1
5.0,It‚Äôs a great movie all the way on the real I enjoyed the movie a lot,1
4.0,I loved the plot and the cinematography. I just wish we could have learned more about the other worlds they visited.,1
0.5,Terrible! Awful story line. Nothing but fighting and bashing body‚Äôs against walls. 2.5 hours of my life I‚Äôll never get back.,-1
5.0,Actually kinda scary in places maybe see it before you take any kids,1
5.0,Cause It Was A Great Movie And I Loved It A Lot?,1
1.5,Needlessly dark with incomplete resolution at the end. The cameos were fun.,-1
3.5,KUDOS TO ANOTHER GREAT MARVEL MASTERPIECE!!,0
0.5,Bad in all realities,-1
4.0,Not a huge fan of the other characters in the film but the storyline was decent and Dr Strange himself is great.,1
4.0,Lots of action very good and clear scenes,1
1.0,"Boring, left before it ended",-1
5.0,I love Marvel comics and the movies really bring them back to me,1
4.0,Loved the storyline and cameos,1
5.0,It was one of the best marvel movies,1
5.0,"Absolutely loved the movie, Big Marvel Fan, a good recommendation I would do before is watching WandaVision on Disney+, it will save a lot of explaining when you‚Äôre watching, other that that, 5/5 because Strange is my absolute favorite hero!",1
5.0,All around great. Major key,1
3.0,The visuals were pretty cool but that‚Äôs about it. I didn‚Äôt really like that they decided to make Scarlett witch the villain going in I thought it was going to be that alternate version of strange or at least that‚Äôs what the trailers led me to believe. Plus they decided to kill off the cool characters for some reason which I thought sucked. Overall it was alright I guess,0
4.5,Great movie! Definitely worth the watch! It will be interesting to see where the marvel universe goes.,1
4.0,good movie but not a fan of the woke stuff I threw in there,1
5.0,"Well done all around. However, it was way too gory to be considered PG-13. It should have been rated R for that.",1
5.0,"This movie was awesome! The plot was so clever and I loved the characters so much! The multiverse is so interesting to think about and the characters and their problems so believable and relatable. I loved the villain and that it she is a woman who is crazy powerful! I loved that! It ranged from being creepy and gory to funny and touching, I just really liked it! So many good things about it. There were a few things that were a little interesting, like the fight with the musical notes, that was cool but it was like it didnt quite have the impact I wanted it to. It was more comical than cool and I wanted it to lean towards cool. Like I was laughing when I wasnt supposed to be. Also at the end when he inhabits his own corpse it was a little over the top sometimes. It reminded me of Hocus Pocus at times. It was a little over the top but I also kinda loved that. But that was really all I disliked and idk if I would even use that word for those things. So yes I loved it! I wish I knew more about what each character did and what their super powers are, but even without knowing anything I still was able to follow everything and enjoy it in every way! I recommend it for sure!",1
3.5,was hard to sit through. maybe 30-45 minutes shorter.,0
4.5,"I liked this movie! Definitely not a typical marvel movie, and certainly not one I could take seriously at some points, but definitely fun! Good action scenes and I liked the plot and pacing. Just don‚Äôt go in expecting your typical marvel experience!",1
2.0,"Bizarre plot, strange movie. Almost felt like it came from an alternate Marvel as it just doesnt really fit with the MCU as we know it so far. The acting was fine but the pacing, music, and even the action scenes just felt weird. This was a movie with a lot of wasted potential. Felt like it tried to be something it wasnt. Definitely not the multiverse movie people probably expect which is too bad. It couldve been so much better.",-1
3.0,"Very action packed, but VERY difficult to follow storyline without seeing the other Marvel movies involving Doctor Strange, which is a bit of a task.",0
3.0,"its only good because its marvel and has the ability to draw from the franchise as a whole. as a standalone, its pretty weak when compared to the others of the franchise. while the villains motivation is weak and tropey, their parts in the film are probably the highlight of the movie.",0
4.0,Had bunch of kids and everyone asked why girl had 2 mothers. Dr Strange and Buz Lightyear will hang out together discussing new opportunities.,1
3.0,So So Movie. Didn't really enjoy this one. The original was so much better.,0
1.0,"Awful movie, all over the place, terrible story line just awful, waste of 2+ hours of my life!",-1
5.0,Wanda/Scarlet Witch in the multiverse of madness. She‚Äôs the star and carries the entire movie! Also the strongest Avenger.,1
4.5,Overall an awesome movie! Avengers kick butt again. But a bit confusing at times.,1
1.0,Very dark. Did not like it at all.,-1
5.0,"Sam Raimi!! Bruce Campbell (can I order a pizza ball please?)!! Great surprises, you can definitely feel old Evil Dead tropes in the filmography, a truly ""Wicked"" Scarlet Witch & Charlize Theron as Clea!!! Seems like the MCU just got a Helluva lot Darker, which is OK by me, bring it on!!",1
4.0,"An awesome film from start to finish. The true star of the show was American Chavez. I can't wait to see her in future marvel films her charisma and sense of adventure made the film a great time. My only issue with the film is the plot . At times the movie felt like it was going to explore one thing but instead ventured somewhere else. Another thing I loved about this film was that audiences get a chance to see more of Dr.Stranges abilities. Of course Wanda aka Scarlett witch was another show stopper , Elizabeth Olsen's performance was amazing. All in all a worthy and great sequel that had Dr.Stange endgame vibes. 9/10.",1
2.5,"it was a little less than expected. although it was not bad, I think that the storyline could've been a little better. Probably could've used another villain or plot.",-1
0.5,Lamest movie Marvel has made next to Morbius.,-1
2.0,"This is more of a horror film than a marvel film. I dont know how else to explain it, but the hero spent way too much time running away from the villain to qualify as a super hero movie. Im sure some will appreciate it the ways in which it deviates from the typical Marvel formula, and perhaps on a second watch I will too. But I didnt enjoy it much and didnt feel like it served Dr. Strange eel as a character.",-1
5.0,I like the whole movie,1
4.0,The sound was extremely loud. enjoyed the movie üçøüé•,1
5.0,Marvel never fails! Awesomeness all the way!,1

5.0,I thought it was a great movie different from every MCU movie I've seen. I immediately wanted to watch it again.,1
0.5,Way Too DARK... TOO confusing....Too strange..... many cabal symbols....did not like at all... waste of money and wasted 2 hours of my life.,-1
3.0,"Madness, multiversed - as expected. Spectacular visuals and‚Ä¶ wait, I forgot what it was about.",0
1.0,if I could give it 0 stars I would.,-1
4.0,Good movie not the normal marvel movie but good in its own way. Worth the watch.,1
2.0,"It wasn't what I was hoping to come back to after 6 years. I think the film lacked basic storytelling structure such an exposition/introduction, a rising climax, and a resolution. I understand that people have been complaining about Marvel's common characters and movies, but I don't think this was a good solution. This movie had so many interesting things to dive into and they only relied on amazing visual effects and not great storytelling. I understand not every Marvel movie is going to be better or match Infinity war a lot Endgame, but this felt boring I literally couldn't stop falling asleep through the movie and I wished I had just waited the 20 min to see Everything Eveywhere instead.",-1
5.0,Great movie! I really enjoyed it!,1

4.0,it could have been better,1
5.0,True to the Dr. Strange character and magic in the comic books of over 50 year's ago!,1
4.5,"The Marvel universe has never looked, and sounded so frightening. Raimi's visuals, and Elfman's soundtrack were superb. The storyline tied a few loose ends together, and opened a few new ones. Don't miss this one!",1
4.0,"Fantastic. They definitely pushed the PG13 rating and I wish they had just let it be rated R. still a ton of fun, good action, visuals, and superb touches of horror.",1

5.0,A must see if you're a Sam Raimi fan!,1
3.5,After Infinity war and Endgame it is hard to give anything 5 stars.,0
4.0,it was a good movie. not a lot of action. story line a little boring,1
5.0,I loved it however It has a lot more gore than I'm used to seeing for Marvel.,1
1.0,did not like you I want my money back!,-1
3.0,not to enthusiastic on how the naned the girl America!?? Seems a bit overboard if you ask me not to mention her acting skills were not that great .,0
1.0,this movie was terrible. I've seen made for TV specials that were better,-1
4.5,It helped that my friends told me I should watch WandaVision on Disney+ BEFORE I go see Dr. Strange in the Multiverse ‚Äì to appreciate more of the storyline ‚Äì so of COURSE i LOVED it.,1
5.0,wanda has never done anything wrong in her life! i love her,1
5.0,Great movie Disney has got to stop with the wind agenda. Two mom's?? Really??,1
4.5,pretty fucking good honestly,1
5.0,Plot was well tied in to story and special effects awesome,1
5.0,much more violent....facial distortions and zombified Dr Strange ew,1
4.0,"Gorgeously crafted, and a well-tended dark garden, rewarding those that have been paying attention to the Disney+ additions to the multiverse. It would have been 5 stars if they had given greater depth to the Darkhold's power over its users instead of immediately painting Wanda as the villain.",1
5.0,"Amazing. First time back to the theater since 2020 and Dr Strange did not disappoint!! Visually stunning, emotional, exciting, lots of fun surprises. Would highly recommend seeing Wandavision first if you havent though. Will make the film that much more impactful.",1
5.0,so good i saw it twice,1

3.5,"not convinced, acting by E. Olsen is weak.",0
2.0,Lots of special effects but not much of a plot. I was disappointed.,-1
2.5,Most of the Visuals were very cool story line felt incomplete or if the movie needed more time for certain scenes.,-1
5.0,"I want to see this again! It was fantastic, the special effects blew my mind, I would not change a thing. It was a good story incorporating the Wanda Vision story and introduced some old and new characters that were fearless. Doctor Strange seemed more human in this film and not as arrogant.",1
5.0,Greatly entertained. Never a dull moment.,1
5.0,Epic and forever the favorite,1
4.5,"I like a movie you have to pay attention to so you don't get lost. This is one of those! Great action, great effects, and great but surprising (to those who don't follow the comics) story!",1
2.0,Good special effects but it was too much on the dark side and do not have to bring in a very Suttle way of LGBT,-1
5.0,I've always enjoyed the Marvel movies. It was good. Love the action and the storyline. My only complaint is the theater I watched it at one of the bulbs was out and no one repaired it before the movie begin.,1
4.0,good movie. the plot could've been better. entertaining!,1
2.0,"Stand alone film. It was a ‚ÄòDoctor Strange‚Äô horror movie. Enjoyable, but they could have done at least a few things to ground it in the MCU we know.",-1
5.0,liked all the twisted and turns. Action was exciting. 7,1
3.0,"Loved Elizabeth Olsen's performance in this! She killed it! As a scarlet witch fan, she definitely did the character justice. But the writing felt a bit lacking at times... a lot of predictable dialogue, one-liners, cheesy scenes, with some shocking moments that might not make sense to fans that don't keep up with the Marvel Universe. The fight scenes were very exciting though - I would definitely see it at least once but wouldn't go back for a second time.",0
5.0,"Excellent movie, can't wait for the next one",1
2.0,It was sad and quite graphic. I was surprised by how much death and gore they showed. Much more than pst movies which mostly only hinted at death and it presented some very dark content as well. Not something for younger children. I know the rating is PG-13 and not for kids but it was closer to R and not something I would want to watch again in theaters and maybe otherwise. Fortunately another parent warned us so we were prepared.,-1
0.5,The plot made no sense. disappointed,-1
1.0,"Huge disappointment. I‚Äôm not sure what I hate most the two hours of my life that I lost or the $26.00 I wasted on the tickets. I‚Äôm a huge Marvel fan., or maybe I was a huge Marvel fan.",-1
4.5,Like the effects and the story.,1
5.0,"EVERYTHING I EXPECTED AND MORE! CONSIDERING THIS DEALT WITH THE MULTIVERSE, WE SHOULD BE SEEING MORE WANDA AND VISION IN FUTURE MOVIES.",1
5.0,Doctor Strange was Awesome loved this movie!!,1
5.0,One needs to make sure and see ALL Dr. strange movies before seeing this one.,1
0.5,"The movie was way too dark for a Marvel. We expected a summer popcorn movie and got more of a zombie/horror flick with plenty of gore, strong language, and very few laughs.",-1
5.0,Great sequel and beyond excited for the next Dr Strange movie!,1
3.5,"Entertaining, but not at my top of list for the MCU films. I would recommend it to anyone who is invested in the Marvel world(s), but not to anyone who is either unfamiliar or has seen none. It doesn't stand on its own. The bigger problem for me is that Sam Raimi is a b-movie director working with a 200 million dollar budget. His sensibility is still that of the guy who made Evil Dead 2 fun ideas, cheesy jokes, silly sight gags, and almost no space for actors do their best work. For one example, Rachel McAdams is a fine actress, but you would never know it from this movie. We all love Bruce Campbell, but his acting style is almost vaudevillian.",0
5.0,"Fantastic movie. Although it could easily have been a Scarlet Witch movie, this did not detract at all, and simply enriched the plot/story.",1
4.0,"A good movie, not for younger viewers.",1
4.5,"I love Dr Strange and this was a fun romp into the multiverse. Plot moves at a good speed, doesn't drag like sone Marvel installments can. Didn't know I needed to be familiar with the Disney+ show to understand some of Scarlet Witch's story.",1
1.0,Nothing great about it. The plot just had too much going on and wasn't all that interesting.,-1
1.0,It was horrible . Did not like it,-1
5.0,Amazing storyline. Loved the old school characters! Amazing technology!!!! One of the beat!,1
5.0,Very unpredictable. Which I liked. Didnt like Wanda getting killed off. Very different from other Marvel movies in that it was bloody and a bit scary for younger kids. The impailment. Yikes! But in all awesome! Just wish I hadnt taken my younger son. Know he will have nightmares.,1
0.5,"If I wanted to go on an emotional roller coaster ride, I would‚Äôve stayed home and talk to my wife‚Ä¶ Not go out to see a superhero movie. It was an emotional mess! And if this is the future of superhero movies, then I‚Äôm done with superhero movies.",-1
2.0,That got weird really quick. Too many additions that made no sense and Krazinski ruined it.,-1
3.0,"I wanted to like it more than I did, but it certainly wasn't terrible. I guess, the bad guys didn't seem all that scary and I never really felt like things were in serious trouble. The movie relies heavily on the effects to carry the story through, so you might as well catch them in 3D.",0
3.0,It was entertaining some plot stuff could have been better and the second protagonist could‚Äôve been written better.,0
2.5,Standard Marvel fare. Average,-1
5.0,Really good not what I expected!!!,1
3.0,Marvel is great and I enjoyed seeing c-men added to mix but this movie was a bit disjointed and if you dont watch Wandavision (which I have not) then there are gaps that are confusing. Overall entertaining and disappointing rolled together.,0
3.5,Price for service fee is outrageous,0
5.0,It was AWESOME!!!!!!,1
4.0,"I like the movie. I didn't like how they made Wanda a villain in this movie, but overall I like it.",1
4.5,Great movie! Good follow up to WandaVision and the What If shows Dr. Strange episode :D,1
5.0,CGI was pretty fabulous! Even got a bit dizzy in one multiverse. LOL Not as much action as we are used to with Marvel but still good. Be sure to stay for the 2 bonus scenes in the credits.,1
5.0,"Must see movie! That‚Äôs all I have to say, best one so far",1
5.0,Intense ride from the start!,1
3.0,A bit too gruesome for PG-13 in my opinion.,0
4.0,CGI not up to par (check out 10 rings) and a little slow. Over all another good marvel movie,1
5.0,The acting is believable. You care about them. The special affects are state of the art. The music works with the scenes.,1
4.0,"not as much multi-verse as I thought there would be, plus the story was completely different from what I thought it would be. I still liked it but it's not one of my favorites.",1
5.0,I little ‚Äústrange‚Äù but it was good!,1
1.0,"dude this has got to be the worst Marvel movie ever not one fight scene, The few action scenes that were there were basic B roll for all marvel movies. No hand to hand personal conflict.",-1
3.5,"I enjoyed it. Was a little disappointed at some of the awesome surprises, and their outcomes. Its hard to explain without spoiling it. Ill definitely watch it again.",0
3.0,"To be positive, I watched the movie because my niece worked on the film so I supported it.",0
4.5,Another Marvel-ous entry in the series.,1
3.0,Confusing and weird! Did not like to lesbian mom thing!!! Keep that out of it and future movies please,0
2.0,"derivative, choppy and boring",-1
5.0,What a great storyline and glad Dr. Strange is finally back! Love that a female was in a lead role.,1
4.0,should of had way more characters and versions of dr strange in but overall a great movie.,1
4.0,Always love Marvel movies - this one was fairly complex in the story line and maybe something I would rather watch at home for the ability to rewind if I missed something. Still though it was a good movie!,1
5.0,We really enjoyed the movie! Like how they tied multiuniversal Dr Stranges.,1
5.0,The entire movie was enjoyable.,1
4.0,Did not meet our expectations of a Marvel movie. It was all fighting and destroying things.,1
2.0,"Interesting horror elements courtesy of Sam Raimi, but poor character development and problematic writing of female characters.",-1
4.5,"Felt a bit rushed, but otherwise a good movie, worth watching.",1
5.0,Very exciting it seemed to answer a lot from endgame and wandavision. And the possibilities of the illuminati hopefully we will see xmen and Inhumans fantastic 4 and more in the future,1
5.0,"Great action, good plot, good humor as always, and good continuity despite scene switching",1
4.0,The accurate portrayal of the other universes. Was vert exciting snd action packed.,1
5.0,it was great and the movie had a great plot twist at the end I can't wait to the next one,1
5.0,So can't wait for the next one,1

5.0,This movie sound effects were awesome. And it was a peaceful atmosphere.,1
3.0,"A disappointing addition to the MCU. Passed the time, but was disjointed and over-the-top, even for a comic-book movie. It was somewhat fun, but I'll have forgotten all about it in a week...",0
5.0,A really good Marvel with alot of twists!,1
4.0,Overall I enjoyed the movie. Good theater experience.,1
5.0,"It was Amazing! Better then the first Doctor Strange movie, amazing visuals and sound track! Amazons characters and story telling",1

3.0,quite a few moments where plot was very slow. I would wait till you can get it via streaming.,0
4.5,"Really good movie!! Great cinematics and action scenes, would not recommend taking small children.",1
4.0,Sam Raimi did a good job directing this movie.,1
2.0,"Too long, too much going on, too much weird for the sake of being weird. Sam Raimi was the wrong choice.",-1
4.0,did not like that Wanda was a bad guy. And I found that the movie was a little difficult to follow at times. But really enjoyed the whole,1
5.0,It was okay but the first one was much more interesting.,1
5.0,Loved the tie in to the other movies. Interesting how they used Wanda as the villian.,1
4.0,Good movie just a lot to keep up with.,1
3.0,Some parts were kind of cheesy,0
2.0,"This was not a representation of what I have come to expect from the MCU. The items that stand out are gruesome deaths, a zombie-like chase, and even the use of zombies. The story was weak and played off the worst series that was pushed out via Disney+. This movie had a lot of potential since it had some setup in Spider-Man Far From Home and also a bit of setup from season 1 of Loki. This story was dark and belonged in the DC universe. I like Sam Rami as a director but I think his style was not suited for the MCU. This was a Sam Rami movie plugged into the MCU. Looking at the power that Wanda has why did the Avengers lose to Thanos? Why did we need Avengers at all. I do not understand why all movie bad guys seem to die after a single serving of them. This story could have created a better logical closure point and a better change in Wanda. 2 minutes of redemption just seems like we didn‚Äôt know how to end the movie so here it is. Strange and Wong were both weaker thank anyone could imagine. What the crap? These guys faced off with Dormamu and Thanos and for some reason they can‚Äôt beat the Scarlett Witch? She is willing to destroy all reality for imaginary children? Just build Vision again. Not to mention one version of Vision did survive WandaVision. Why did we not go that direction? Why did all the wants in the other realities stand up to Scarlett Witch? Lots of directions we could have gone. But no! We just sucked it up. Thanks for the 2nd or possibly 3rd worst movies in the MCU depending on how you rank Eternals, Thor Dark world, and whether you could Dark Phoenix as part of the MCU.",-1
3.0,"This Dr Strange was a bit too ""comic-bookish"" for my taste this time. I liked the cinematography, but I did not think the storyline was strong for this movie. Of course I will still go to the theater to see the next one as I like the characters.",0
4.0,It was an okay movie!,1
4.0,Great action and effects. Story a little lacking but still a fun watch.,1
5.0,"BC very good, Rachel McAdams also good, Wanda probably the best actor of the bunch",1
4.0,Really good...but really long,1
3.0,Visual effects are incredible. You kinda need to watch WandaVision for it to understand how Wanda became sooo powerful and why she has kids. Parts were Marvel awesome but there were parts that had me scratching my head and rolling my eyes corny. It could have been great but they cheesed it up.,0
5.0,the movie was awesome and a lot of surprises,1
3.0,"Overall, as much as others complain, I think the story was good, and made sense for the most part. For all of those complaining about the path of the Scarlet Switch, have you never heard of any of the comic series where a character kills the marvel universe??? Anyway... regardless, there were some moments in the movies where you just question what the heck is going on, and if course, Sam Raimi has a style of his own that you immediately recognize as the film progresses. I feel like his directorial style at times is just too much. proposal would have been better to me with a different director but the same story. Overall, while not the greatest entry into the MCU, it was an entertaining film. The story was pretty good and the effects were very good. Something tells me that a more films are released, this Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness will make more sense and become more important in the grand scheme of things.",0
5.0,Great action fast moving,1
4.0,"Action packed, good storyline. A few lame comments.",1
4.0,A bit of eye rolling. Story nowhere as clever as original. But was entertaining,1
1.0,It was extremely hot in the theater. So hot that I left less than a hour into the movie!!,-1
3.5,Standar marvel movie.,0
2.0,Very disappointing. I was expecting a Dr. Strange sequel not a WandaVision sequel. Cumberbatch seemed awkward this time around and the story was terrible.,-1
3.0,The movie was great in the beginning. I feel asleep in the end,0
0.5,Horrible movie! So boring and my kids fell asleep.,-1
3.0,Nothing new here but the creatures are decent enough. Nicolas Cage is wasted here and the story has been done better before but overall not a bad way to waste some time,0
4.0,I enjoyed this movie. Lots of tense moments and a couple of good jump scares. I would recommend seeing.,1
3.5,The movie was interesting but sometimes confusing. Too much of the filming was nighttime scenes which were hard to make out.,0
5.0,Kept us on the edge of our seats !,1
5.0,I loved this movie. I would definitely recommend seeing it!,1
1.5,"Execution was questionable. Coupled with not knowing what exactly the characters are facing, with extremely dark cinematography and shaky-cam, Arcadian merely scratches the surface, leaving a not-so-great impact in the finale. Wait for streaming.",-1
2.0,"Movie had incredible potential but falls flat on its face about half way through. Nicholas Cage is a great performance. Actually there are no bad performances. All actors and actresses are trying and do well with the material they are given, but Cage is the stand out performance. I‚Äôll say the direction seems weak at times. Line delivery and tone can be strange and unfitting to the scenes at times. Scenes can also feel stretched and boring with the dialogue not doing enough to justify the screen time, especially with the romance / relationship the movie tries to develop. The monsters were really interesting and scary, until you actually get to see them. I saw this with my family and we burst out laughing. The monsters also lose a lot of their scare power as the movie goes on, as they get sillier and stupider. I‚Äôve seen some reviews saying the monsters were terrifying, and I have to disagree. Maybe if you‚Äôre 10 years old and you‚Äôve never seen a scary movie before. It‚Äôs mostly cheaper jump scares. Walked out disappointed as the first half was REALLY good, but dropped the ball in the second and third acts. Really wouldn‚Äôt recommend unless you‚Äôre into the ‚Äúso bad it‚Äôs funny‚Äù kind of movies.",-1
3.5,A low budget creature feature with surprisingly great effects and performances. The movie is punching above it's weight but is ultimately weighed down by an enemy that is just too easy to kill or run away from.,0
3.5,"Not bad, just average at best",0
4.0,"Extremely well done and tense little end of the world thriller. Great acting from all, and the creature design is one of the most unique I've ever seen. Really worth checking out. These gems from Nic Cage keep coming. I love it!!!",1
4.0,Actors did a good job. Movie was suspenceful and well done. Many scenes could have been shot with a little more illumination. The creatures were terrifying.,1
3.5,"some really great camera work and cinematography solid tension p much all the way through& another win for Nicolas Cage, whole cast really",0
3.0,Played just like I Am Legend,0
3.0,"Enjoyed the movie for the most part. Good tension and suspense. However, the monsters were a letdown.",0
5.0,Don‚Äôt really understand the audience negativity - this was original & awesome creature design. Very unique approach while also taking its time with the grounded themes of family and survival. Not to mention this being a smaller budget film. Loved it!!!,1
5.0,Brewer‚Äôs version of post-apocalyptic monsters is novel. Great acting from Cage and the young cast. The Father‚Äôs love and sacrifice for his Sons üò¢,1
3.5,As far as apocalyptic-horrors go -- this is one of the freshest and most humane I've seen. üçÖ,0
2.0,"I was skeptical of this film before I viewed it. I am a fan of Nicolas Cage, but the plot and theme were already overused and predictable. Cage's performance was not his best. It was also predictable. The son who appears to be the wiser son, was good. The alien-like creatures that are portrayed as the enemy to mankind in this film were garish and computer created templates. I left feeling that I wasted my price of admission and felt cheated out of a good film. I am not going into the genre itself, the worthiness of the film itself, I am just being simple in stating to anyone who might choose this film as entertainment - it is not on my list.",-1
2.0,This movie made no sense. The story was all over the place. The creatures were ridiculous. Don't waste your money,-1
5.0,Fun creepy apocalyptic movie with a different take on what creatures might take us over. Good story line and keeps you in suspense,1
0.5,Movie was totally shot in pitch black So frustrating Creatures seemed like they would have looked great but couldn't see a thing. So when they finished shooting the film and watched it they didn't notice that you couldn't see a damn thing?? Unbelievable I actually yelled out loud in the theater in frustration!,-1
4.0,"Arcadian is a simple, but very solid thriller. I love Nicholas Cage, and his acting, along with the rest of the limited cast, was great. The sound design and character building was fantastic, and I really enjoy the story. There wasn't many situations that could've been avoided, and the characters were smart and well written. The score was also a highpoint. Overall I really liked Arcadian, and although its not perfect, its a very solid and enjoyable movie.",1
3.0,So so. Not really all that good. Watchable. About it.,0
1.0,Im a Nicholas Cage fan but this movie was very lame. Waste of money.,-1
5.0,Great Anime movie and continuation of season 2 of Spy x Family!,1
4.0,"Fun movie that stays true to the spirit of the show. The movie starts a little slow before really picking up in the second half. Definitely would recommend to any fans. To someone not familiar with the source material, enough is explained that the story will make sense, but it might be a bit out there.",1

5.0,"Very fun movie! Feels like classic Spy x Family. Some good action scenes, funny moments, and lots of feel good heartwarming moments. The art and animation were also fantastic.

5.0,Action scenes went crazy,1
4.5,"Despite the film doesn‚Äôt have any bearing on the overall plot, the need for more of the Forgers specially in the silver screen is a must. Very entertained from start to finish.",1

5.0,"not a movie about politics. A movie that displays what you get when you stop working with your neighbors, strangers, and or political differences. It is ugly and a display of hatred and chaos which happens quite easily across the world.",1
4.0,"Alex Garland‚Äôs #CivilWar is an absolute triumph in every way possible! I‚Äôm absolutely blown away by how visually beautiful and striking this movie is. Garland does a good job of representing something that could happen at any split second in our world today, in reality. It‚Äôs emotionally gripping and tense, and Kirsten Dunst did a superb job, along with Ron Swanson, and the rest of the cast! Seeing this movie in #IMAX is the best way to watch it! Absolutely brilliant! 4/5",1
5.0,My boyfriend and I just finished watching this movie. We absolutely loved it!! It was so good we didn't want it to end! Dakota Johnson and the rest of the cast did amazing!!! We felt everything Dakota was giving in the film!! We hate that people are hating on this movie and Dakota when she absolutely killed it!!! Others just need to stop hating on her for branching out and stepping into a different role/character. Again SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING and is with every role she does. We really like how the story line went in the movie and how you think you know what's coming or how it will end but it doesn't so there was always something keeping us on our toes. We just really hope to see a second movie! Loved it! Go watch it!,1
0.5,"Worst movie I've ever seen. Super cringe, bad acting, poor direction, cheap looking effects and action scenes, poorly written story, awkward casting with no chemistry. 800 million dollar budget and not a single good moment or redeeming quality whatsoever.

0.5,Worst movie I ever seen,-1
1.0,Horrible. But at least better than Morbius.. üíÄüíÄ,-1
0.5,The most embarrassing part isn't the obvious terribleness of this movie... it's that everyone keeps thinking Dakota Johnson can lead a movie or even act at all. There isn't a shred of evidence that she can. It's time we stop pretending.,-1
0.5,This is just a discrase to comic book movies I‚Äôm not gonna say too much because anything I say has already been said.,-1
3.5,"So this is not the best movie, just gonna say that up front but imo it DOES NOT deserve all the hate it gets. I feel like the movie would have been a little better if it had fewer characters and it didn't really need to involve the parkers but it was still a fun watch. The action was pretty well choreographed and the whole visions of the future thing was well done imo. The very end was pretty dumb, I get they were trying to do a nod to the comicbook character but just a daredevil style blind character with a cane would have been a whole lot less cringe.",0
1.0,"Believe the critics! Sony's solo attempt in the Marvel universe without Sam Raimi flops once again! First off, this movie isn't MCU-connected despite what the trailers imply; it's a standalone movie. So, if you're hoping for some post-Endgame MCU nods, you're out of luck. Second, the plot is a hot mess and full of holes. If you asked me, I couldn't tell you how Cassie gets her powers, how the villain got his powers, his motives, his background,or what even connects the girls and Madame Webb to one another even though that's the premise of the entire movie. This might have worked better as a tv series so there's time to explain everything, but as a movie? the lack of explanations just left me scratching my head. Third, despite the Marvel association, action is sorely lacking. Most of the action is Cassie running people over with her car. Almost the entire movie is a repetitive cycle of 'villain shows up, heroines run away. There's no 'suit up' moment, no character growth of the girls becoming the superheroes the villain sees in his vision of the future, just them freaking out and running away. And let's not even start on the CGI it's more suited to bargain-bin streaming than a 80 million budget blockbuster marvel-ish(?) movie. Something silly to add, I don't think the actor who plays the main villain is a native english speaker because there's some really bad ADR dubbing that is not in sync with his mouth during his scenes. Like...old english dubbed japanese movies bad. But what truly spurred this snarky review you're now reading was the horrible acting, particularly Dakota Johnson's. Her lack of expression and monotone delivery made even the more humorous dialogue unwatchable. It's clear she didn't inherit any of the charm or acting talent of her parents. I don't know who in their right mind thought she was a good fit for the lead role in a superhero movie. The scene where she points to the ceiling saying ""that's your emergency, that"" and it cuts to the main villain crawling on the ceiling towards her like a madman but she delivers the line with about as much urgency as if her soup arrived cold at the table. Jesus Christ! Her acting is what you'd get if you handed this script to a lobotomy patient and the director yells ""action!"" Save yourself the agony and just go rewatch Spider-Man: No Way Home instead of this garbage. It's a far better use of your time and money.",-1
0.5,Paid $20.00 to watch on demand. Absolutely a waste. Poor plot and the acting was embarrassing! I watched till the end and have no positive remarks to make. A waste of time and money.,-1
1.0,"Do not watch this movie. I wasted 2 hours of my life to watch a movie that ended dakotas career. The story is bad, the acting is horrible, the cgi is terrible. This directed was given a chance to show case her skills. She probably won't direct another movie again.",-1
2.0,Marvel - did you read this script? It's terrible. Madame Web's story is interesting - but the way it played out was so dang cheesy. Her in the wheelchair with those silly red glasses at the end pretty much caps off the whole film.,-1
5.0,Loved the story and characters! They did a good job of sprinkling humor throughout as well. I was captivated the entire time. Would 100% recommend! I'll be buying this digitally so I can rewatch it as many times as I want.,1

5.0,"It was so well made, Sydney Sweeney is amazing as Julia Carpenter, and Dakota Johnson nailed the role.",1
1.5,"While this movie was absolutely horrible in almost every way, that in turn made it incredibly funny to watch. I legitimately had such a good time with my friends laughing at how bad this movie was, and I suppose that counts for something.",-1
3.5,"Web Of Shadows. This film is good, but it could have been great. The first half sets you up for something that never happens but that will happen in a future film which is kind of a letdown, but overall not a bad film. I also can't stress how refreshing it is to see a super hero film in this day and age where I don't have to see 20+ other movies and/or shows in order to fallow the thing. You can just enjoy this as its own stand alone film and it is all the better for it. I think it is safe to say a lot of people wanted to hate this movie well before it came out and there is a lot of bias at play here with the reviews against it. See it for yourself and make up your own mind. Don't be a sheep that follows trolls.",0
5.0,Loved it was a brilliant film,1
1.0,I don't usually leave reviews but I have just watched madame Webb and it was one of the most awful movies I have ever seen. I would leave 0 stars if I could. The script is rubbish and Dacota Johnson's acting is so terrible that it is painfully to watch. Do NOT watch this movie if you value your time and money,-1
0.5,"Absolutely a waste. The whole storyline was all over the place. They are trying too hard to make you hope it might be a good marvel movie but failed dismally to create one. The acting was terrible, I don't thing dakota was the right actress for this roll she is better off being spanked in 50 shades. I felt my brain melting with the boring story line.",-1
1.0,"I felt that the casting in this movie was questionable with the exception of Sweeney and Adam Scott. This movie hits some very perfect notes of universe references right to Ben Parker being at his unborn nephew's mother's baby shower. Adam Scott delivers nearly flawless execution of every scene and has a pervect level of relatability to a common man with influence of a super hero (in the future). Johnson has the acting range of Liv Tyler, but that may be the limitation of the director's focus and capabilities. The story is disjointed and confusing. Another strog point was the sheer terror that the 'Dark Spider' presents when attacking and gives insight as to how an evil Spiderman would be. The voice dubbbing was an insult to the actor and signs of the traditional Sony comittee inteference. I feel that The Spiderverse flicks were near perfection becasue these committees and executives viewed animation as unimportant and disposable. Sony has a problem in that Sony causes the problem and, on a corporate level, suffers the Dunning-Kreuger Effect and lacks the intelligence to see the lack of intelligence they have. Its worth seeing, but not at cinema prices.",-1

I saw the other reviews going into the Movie thinking that a lot of people were over exaggerating, but no this movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen I could only write bad notes about this movie. first, Like I get the fact that his movie is scientific-fiction but this just crossed the line. A spider that can paralyze you and kill you? Then why wasn't the baby at least a little bit disabled? Oh that's right instead of her being disabled she gets super powers and holds a bunch of teens hostage so she doesn't go to jail. Which makes no sense at all because if you hold teens hostage then you will have a grater chance of going to jail. Speaking of the topic there is one scene where she is being handcuffed and then when the guy comes, which we'll talk about later, when they run the handcuffs just disappear. the guy is just a bad reboot of Spider-Man the story telling sucks, and lastly all the blood is just a bit of food coloring. DO NOT WATCH!!!",-1
0.5,"Boring film, without meaning or morals. Sony wants to destroy the Spider-Man universe, and it is succeeding. I think that without a doubt this is the worst superhero film in recent years and I think it's impossible for anyone to take that title away from this film. HORROROUS!!!!!!",-1

2.5,"Madame web Madame Web emerges as the origin tale of Cassie Webb. Her quest leads her to rescue three girls from the clutches of Ezekiel Sims, a ruthless figure intent on their demise to evade his own fate at their hands in the future. Films in Sony's Spider-Man universe have received criticism, and Madame Web isn't exempt from that. However, contrary to many reviews, Madame Web is a straightforward and enjoyable superhero film. It doesn't aim for grandeur, which aligns well with its storyline. Despite uninspiring dialogue hinted at in trailers, the actual movie doesn't suffer from this. Though not particularly imaginative, the dialogue effectively propels the story forward. The film effectively captures the nostalgia of its 2003 setting. The soundtrack plays a significant role in this, and the homage to Beyonc√©'s ""Dangerously In Love"" was a delightful touch. Madame Web does indeed encounter several challenges. The unfolding of subplots relies too heavily on convenient occurrences, which can be frustrating for viewers. While the exploration of the titular character's powers is intriguing, it diminishes the suspense that should accompany this genre of film. As obstacles arise, the predictability of their resolution removes any sense of genuine tension or dread. For a superhero movie where the principal characters are battling a villain palpably stronger and possessing no impressive powers of their own, the action scenes manage to be more effective than one would expect. The performances in this film may not be stellar, but they are well-suited to their roles. Dakota Johnson portrays just the right balance of detachment and confusion required for her character. Her reluctance to embrace heroism is palpable and serves as a driving force throughout the movie. The rest of the cast also meet the expectations for their respective roles. Numerous aspects of Madame Web require refinement and clarification but it's notable that the runtime isn't adversely affected. Surprisingly, the two-hour duration passes smoothly without feeling prolonged or dragged out. Madame Web would benefit from better writing but overall it's a simple and decent movie that knows what it is and doesn't try to go beyond that. 5.5/10",-1
0.5,"I was eager to watch Madame Web, but I was disappointed by the poor writing. The movie lacked depth. The dialogue, especially for the antagonist, was particularly bad.",-1

0.5,"I don't know where to start, I thought it was a parody film (at least I'll be ok with that), but apparently this film is a million dollar production. The acting is very bad, the transitions make no sense and are sometimes awkward. The characters seem to have their dialogues in front of their eyes. The main character is supposed to be a paramedic, but I don't think anyone would trust her with their life, given the troll-like scenes. Let's not even talk about the visions, she doesn't understand what they're trying to tell us after 1 hour in the film. The whole film seemed to be a perfect parody, but that didn't seem to be the point. Save your time and money and get out.",-1

1.5,"Story was mediocre, saw it in theaters. I felt like there was so much money put into this, but it ended up being a disappointment. It was funny at some moments, other jokes didn't land well. If you don't want spoilers, skip to the next review, but why and how does the antagonist not die to the miniature bombs know as fireworks, survive gunshots, grenades, fire, but die to a falling sign? It feels like the budget was running low so they had to end the movie early. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but definitely not Marvel quality.",-1
5.0,Great movie! We will need an additional Madame Web!,1
0.5,"Absolutely rubbish, the most ridiculous unbelievable made modern film I've ever seen....the story, the acting, the actual whole context of the film plotline if you could call it that is just a complete farce. How did someone not notice this during the production of this rubbish. Dakota Johnson must seriously have been hard up for cash to agree and then continue to do this thrash, there is no other explanation because it has single handedly destroyed whatever reputation she might have had in the acting world. I usually am more forgiving when I see bad reviews of films, I always feel that the reviewer didn't understand the point of the film whether it be just a no brainer action film or a serious proper epic but in this case I am the one who is 100% standing tall in saying that Madame Web is probably the worst modern film I've ever seen....end of!",-1

0.5,"Verily, let me regale thee with a lamentation of cinematic proportions, for 'Madame Web' doth stand as a testament to the egregious misadventures of modern filmmaking. With an air of anticipation akin to the unveiling of a grand tapestry, I embarked upon this odyssey of moving pictures, only to find myself ensnared within a maelstrom of mediocrity. Verily, the plot unfurls like a tangled skein, weaving a narrative so convoluted that even the most astute of scholars would find themselves lost amidst its labyrinthine machinations. In truth, 'Madame Web' doth serve as a veritable magnum opus of disappointment, a cacophony of cinematic sins that assail the senses with all the subtlety of a rampaging herd of swine. From its lackluster performances to its insipid dialogue, every facet of this cinematic endeavor doth conspire to transform what could have been a masterpiece into naught but a hot pile of dog dudu. Alas, if thou art tempted to partake in this ill-fated venture, I implore thee to spare thyself the torment and seek solace in more worthy pursuits.",-1

2.0,"Weak Marvel comic book character who has never been popular enough to score her OWN comic book, inexplicably is the leading character in this new superhero epic.

I should have listened to other reviews that told me it was bad before I watched it. I'm not usually skeptical of movies and can sit through most movies that flopped, but this movie was the last straw for me.",-1

This was kind of like that instead it was Marvel made by Sony! the ones that also made Morbius. Overall the concept of this is cool and it's like the Marvel comics but it just wasn't good and Sydney Sweeney is just to good of an actor to be in this like it literally got a 12 percent and is rotten like have you seen Sydney on Euphoria???",-1

0.5,"I think this is the worst cinecomic in history. During the duration of the entire film nothing happens with scenes where the camera moves randomly making you feel bad. All the characters are flat without in-depth analysis. The film does not give explanations of any kind about what is happening. In addition, the film has a very badly done CGI. I think it's even worse than the Morbius movie which at least in that movie had scenes that made you laugh and that became memes",-1

5.0,"When it comes to ""Madame Web,"" I've noticed there's been a bit of a stir, but honestly, I'm a bit puzzled by all the fuss. It seems like some folks went in expecting the usual Marvel roller coaster, but here's the thing‚ÄîI'm all for mixing it up. Why settle for the same old plots when we can explore something new, right? Personally, I found ""Madame Web"" to be a breath of fresh air. Sure, it had a few moments where things felt a bit offbeat, but doesn't every movie? These little quirks didn't spoil my fun; if anything, they added a unique flavor to the whole experience. The movie really shines by stepping off the beaten path and giving us something different from the Marvel universe. And let's be real, in a world teeming with superhero tales, bringing something new to the table isn't just nice‚Äîit's necessary. All in all, ""Madame Web"" was a pretty enjoyable ride for me. It's a reminder that there's room in the superhero genre for all kinds of stories, and I'm here for it. The movie might not hit the mark for everyone, but it's definitely a bold step in a refreshing direction.",1

Like the teen girls in the movie felt like NPC's (Non-playable characters) that have 2-3 lines that fit their age group. No depths in their characters at all. We had moments of their lives within the movie, but they were the meat of the plot? I wish they gave us more. Made us feel for why they had to run more desperate. Death in this movie had been taken lightly because I thought Cassie could reverse it. However, that's not how her powers work and it confirms that she's not omnipotent.",0

She is coolish, bit awkward and stuff.. but as the movie goes on it looses all the magic very fast.

The MC and the main villain start to seem very flat.. and the part where the girls just randomly dance on a table for the guys...? Like i understand they are all abandoned and have issues.. but nerd girl played 2 different roles.. it did not seem like a girl having fun.. it felt like 2 different people playing 2 different roles. Most of the special effect are decent atleast, some aren't. Some scenes really dont add up.. like the police hunting the girls and stuff and why can't anyone else see the spider villain. (I might just have missed that part) also how did the MC make the truck fly? The maybe uncle ben reference was cool tho. Overall. This could've had allll the potential in the world but they missed the mark by a mile with wrong casting, lacking better special effects, directing choices and the script.",-1

3.5,"I feel a lot of people are super mean about low budget films. Because of critics like these low budget films sometimes don't get made. When the low budget films are the ones that need to be made to spread the good news. In this case‚Ä¶ I though the fact that Nicolas Cage took this portrayal as an actor (whom choose their roles) was pretty cool of him. You rarely see big time actors take on Christian world view roles. For the sake of a community that might not have otherwise watched this type of film. I personally do believe the rapture is going to happen, also any day now for the time and seasons of this age are present and all around us. The Bible is 1/4 prophecy in a whole and most people don't realize that because people don't want to talk about that anymore now days (prophecy fulfilled btw). It is called the blessed hope for a reason it is an escape of the coming wrath of God for an evil and Christ rejecting world. If you did like this movie Kevin Sorbo just made its sequel recently. It really hit home to how the world has changed in the last few years. Which has brought the Christian view of pre-rapture and end times theology to life and ""real"" in the way the world is headed currently!!",0

It does have some good tension in the second half of the movie. But for a Christian movie, it has very little Gospel in it, most of what is there is regulated to the ""nut jobs"". Not much character here, the movie focusing on the disaster...what there is of it. You just want the movie to be better than it is.",-1
3.5,"Out of the Rapture topic of films out there, this one is perhaps the better one regarding the biblical topic of what may happen when Yeshua (aka Jesus the Jewish Messiah) calls out and takes out all the believers and followers on Earth.

3.5,Ein solider Action Film von Nicolas Cage mit einem spannenden und gleichzeitig fragen aufwerfenden Ende,0
4.0,What I liked is there is plenty of action and it deals head-on with the essence of belief and takes on a plot idea that is rarely or never approached. Nicholas Cage as usual is totally and enthusiastically committed in the role. Gotta say - other reviews I have seen are tough - seem to mix up their own views on Christianity with a movie about Christianity.,1
3.5,"I'm very surprised that I actually liked it. Given the subject matter, I was worried it was either going to be too pro-religion with lots of ""preaching"" or too anti-religion and just a hate fest against religious folks. But instead the movie focused on the characters and how they dealt with the immediate dangers that they faced. There's not much of an arc for anyone as it's played mostly as an action movie. It felt like they might've been setting up for a sequel where some of the characters would find some sort of meaningful change, but sadly that doesn't happen here and there's no sequel I can find. But I did think it was an enjoyable and entertaining way to pass the time. Nicholas Cage is great as usual, Cassi Thomson was very good and believable as his daughter, and I was really surprised at how good Nicky Whelan was as the flight attendant that Nic Cage's character is having an affair with. That character could easily have been a typical clich√©d ""evil other woman"" and ""flight attendant from hell"" who hates her passengers. But Whelan (and the writers) make her very real and interesting. There's some unnecessary, and thankfully brief, subplots on the plane, but overall I found it a pleasant surprise.",0
0.5,Glad this movie is downright forgotten because it's complete trash. They should leave this movie left behind in the dumpster.,-1
0.5,"First I don't believe the ""rapture"" is ever going to happen. Two reasons, I don't think all the ""good"" people are going to taken to Heaven body and soul naked so Jesus and the Antichrist to go all ""Mortal Kombat"". Second, the Rapture is a fantasy of conservative Christianity who thinks Heaven is harder to get into than Harvard. All the kids get to go like kids can't sin? I take it director Vic Armstrong has no kids. Because they sin all the times. Hell, the Muslim kid is raptured, which makes no sense. Considering his Muslim dad was ""left behind"". So what's the sin here? If it's not being Christian than the Muslim kid should go and it's not being Muslim, what was the dad's sin. The sins that caused them to be left behind. The adultry of the pilot I can understand. But being addicted to drugs is not a sin, they need help. Also the PG-13 dumbing it down, like a Pureflix was behind it. One scene a guy goes flying through a window after being shot in the face by a shot gun but the blood was white. It feels like a Estus Pirkle sermon. But Estus Pirkle's movie wouldn't dumb it down, that guy wouldn't have a face anymore. Lastly, the whole Rapture is nothing but people vanishing without seeing their naked bodies floating to Heaven, again thank you PG-13. It's nothing but bullshit conservative hypocrisy. Read the Bible, not made up things like The Rapture or Dante's Inferno.",-1

The only one who was slightly good in this movie was Michael Pitt. The lead character (Edger something) I had seen before on the life story of Gianni Versace and he was good in that.

There were so many subplots that detracted from the main idea without connecting, that following what I guess the writer was attempting to convey was not possible. So many characters were completely unnecessary and only caused confusion. Edgar Ramirez, a gifted actor, gave such a stilted, wooden performance that one would assume that this was his first time in front of the camera. What was he thinking taking this role?

3.0,"This was nowhere NEAR as bad as the reviewers' consensus makes it out to be. It's not great, but neither is it so horrendous as to deserve a 0% rating. It's just your basic cliche-ridden action flick. But it reaches for originality and creativity, which is more than you can say for most. The acting is fine; Ramirez, Pitt, and Brewster serve the film well. Copley and Bergin might as well have been non-name actors for as much attention as they draw to themselves. The dystopian, Big Brother theme can never be overplayed, given the world in which we live. The only problem with it is the fact that we're supposed to be rooting for outright criminals for no other reason than that they're the ones the government is trying to stop. That's hardly a reason to make a hero out of Bricke; let's face it, he's a dirtbag. The only reason he's at all appealing is Ramirez's attraction. But I stand by my rating. This movie is not remotely worthless.",0
1.5,"""The Last Days of American Crime"" presents a lot of violence and ugliness, but that's actually not the aspect of the movie that bothered me. This movie is a complete waste of an actually good concept. I think a more talented writer and director could have pulled off something complex and interesting. This movie fails on many levels and is a big mess. For one, it is way too long without ever justifying it. The movie spends a lot of time with exposition and world-building but it is so boring and poorly handled. A few action scenes do happen but I didn't care at all about the outcome. If characters died I felt nothing and there were no stakes I really cared about. Overall, this is one of this year's weakest offerings and one of Netflix's worst investments in recent memory.",-1

It's really not that different FROM countless other American action films except that in this case, it's not really 'good' guys going after 'bad' guys.... ...In this case there aren't any 'good' guys at all- just a case of whose behaviour is the worst of all...If this were a film franchise with a favorite 'name' actor in it, I believe a lot more film goers would be OK with seeing the 'baddest' eggs getting their just deserts...Perhaps also ,since the story line was pulled from a graphic novel in which the USA was rapidly in danger of becoming a police state , which many of us believe is happening daily in 'real time', that analogy has made many people uncomfortable with the amoral violence that happens in this film....Maybe if the Gerald Butler look-alike main actor had actually had that wildly popular action star in it, there wouldn't be so many negative ratings on this typical run-of-the -mill crime film...It's certainly not the worst popcorn flick I've ever seen....",-1

Actually anyone involved that allowed it to happen should never work in the industry again. Their calling has to be in some other type of industry. I did not read the comic.

0.5,"Easily the worst film I have seen in a very long time and I found myself willing it to end after about 45 minutes which is when your brain cells start to die off from being subjected to this brain rot but alas it's over 2 hours long! I'm not sure if anyone responsible for making this rubbish, actually bothered to make sure the basic story made any sense when it came to editing. As there are only a few scenes that attempt to bring the mindless shooting and explosions together to form some sort of plot, you would think they would try and do a good job on them but no. I will give some examples: Hours before the heist They go to Pitts characters family home and kill his father for no reason at all, maybe just to add some pre-heist tension as he gets shot and is badly injured before the heist but even that doesn't work as he makes a miraculous recovery after brick leaves him bleeding out on the floor of a car park. I do recal them needing to steal some explosives so they might have been there for that purpose but it seems they forget to actually do that. They finally break into the bank, 2 of them just get in a lift directly to the vault, one of them gets into the building disguised as a garbage man and the girl rings up a random guy who comes with no back story, and says ""I just didn't know where else to go"". That guy invites her in, without question, to the main control room for the signal thing and tries to kiss her? So the guys in the vault room blow up the vault locks, the door opens and out walks....the garbage man???? Oh and he has a forklift truck in there as well. How they get out is just as a mystery as how the garbage man got into the locked vault as the scene just jumps from the vault to the corridor where they make their effortless escape. Not sure why they bothered blowing the door up if you could just walk in through the back? The girl is an ace hacker tasked with the mission to dissable the signal thing. She goes to great effort to successfully disable it for 30 mins. When the signal comes back on it apears that Pitts character is immune to it so the whole story thus far is pointless. A ""good"" cop shows up to ask the girl ""what the hell is going on"". They had attempted to give this cop a back story but it served no purpose and I found myself hoping his question was going to be answered as I had no idea either. A fight scene broke out and he died. The girl then goes back and blows up the server room anyway so hacking it to give them 30 mins in the first place was pointless if it can be permanently disabled. Brick and the girl make their escape to Canada in a magical semi truck which barely has a scratch on it after a face full of military fire power and concrete road blocks at the boarder and luckiy for them, the military just gave up pursuing them once they smashed through. After a minute of deep romance, brick dies and she lives happily ever after. Well she did manage to go and collect her partner in crimes ashes before hand but yeah. Total garbage!",-1

As someone who is regularly subjected to watching terrible action movies due to my husband's questionable taste, this really is saying something.

This movie is really poorly edited, typical of Oliver Megaton, there's 10 cuts every second. The script is laughalby bad, with some terrible dialogue. I don't know if this counts as an action movie, as there are very few proper action scenes. At least the actors give good performances considering what they're working with. This movie is almost 2 hours and a half and yet it still manages to feel rushed. I don't know what happened here. The Last Days of American Crime is not good, don't watch it.",-1

5.0,"It is a rare occasion that you stare into a film and the film stares back at you. The Last Days of American Crime is a stroke of genius. The beautifully executed two-dimensional characters lul us into a false sense of security, tempting us to mock the film as the depths of cheap modern entertainment. But as the plot unfolds and each would-be action hero discredits themselves, we see the true cheap entertainment is the movie which our own simplistic expectations demanded. Megaton gleefully refuses to let the movie become a hero story or even a political statement as was Minority Report. When Sharlto Copley utters the words ""what the hell is going on"", it speaks not only to the tangled web of a plot but to our tangled post-post-modern reality. The Last Days of American Crime is not a fun summer blockbuster, though some may mistake it for such, it is also not an irredeemable pile of trash, as it has been called by many an unenlightened film reviewer. The Last Days of American Crime is a masterstroke, a challenge to our expectations as movie-goers, and it does not care what you think.",1

The movie was interesting to watch because it was interesting to see 2 hours of story extracted from 21 hours of audio book... it was an interesting summary of the plot. But very very badly done. The worst thing about the movie was the best thing about the book... the characters. The film needs to have been something like Seven. And for me the main character in the book was Keith... the actor who plays Keith is terribly inappropriate for Keith both in terms of his physical attributes and oh my god his terrible terrible acting (mugging I think it is called). In the book Keith is evil, but you end up liking the character, not the person, and his catch phrases and his strengths and weaknesses, his either/neither and his such-likes... he should have been Sasha Baron Cohen's Grimsby. Guy and Samson were spot on. In the book Guy has so many funny episodes but they were ALL missing from the movie. Samson. Nicola is almost more of a plot device than a person in the book, a force of nature. In the movie she is cryingly bad, like someones teenage daughter wandered on the set and tried to act (and Keith is someones teenage son doing the same). Nicola in the book has poise and confidence and is crazy, Amber Heard is just a stupid. Their was nothing of Keith's family life, or his car, or his shed. Or Guys home-life, and Marmaduke and his interactions with the nannies and also with Keith and Nicola, and Lilly Boo etc etc. The movie should have been focussed on the intensely edgy scenes that took place between the characters. It focussed on the wrong characters and the wrong story, But if you have read or listened to the book it was interesting",0

2.5,"Every once in a while, you come across a film that you know little, to nothing about, but it's premise is so intriguing that you just have to check it out. London Fields was that film for me. Prior to four months ago, I had never even heard of this film, but after seeing the trailer and reading the synopsis, I knew it was something that I'd have to experience for myself. And no matter what the critics say, and that includes myself, this is advice everyone should follow, as the subjectivity of film is what makes it such a beautiful experience. London Fields tells the story of Nicola Six, a clairvoyant femme fatale who can see people's deaths before they happen... including her own. She meets three men - Samson Young, an aging writer desperately seeking inspiration for his next book; Guy Clinch, a rich aristocrat looking for happiness in his life; and Keith Talent, a ne'er-do-well with a penchant for playing darts - one of whom she knows will be her murderer. I really dug this premise. It sounded interesting and unique, and with the stacked cast it has, I felt like it would at least be a consistently interesting film. Unfortunately, it falls a bit flat throughout, not quite living up to its potential. I loved the idea of a modern neo-noir, which isn't something you see too often. And for the most part, it hit that tone beautifully. But there were some uneven parts that pulled me out of the film at times, particularly the scenes with Keith (Jim Sturgess) toward the end. They just didn't fit for me. It felt like a completely different movie with a huge tonal shift, which made it more difficult to get back into the rest of the film. And even though I love Jim Sturgess, I felt like he was a bit too over-the-top with this character. On the flip side of that, Theo James' character, Guy Clinch, was a tad boring. Only towards the end did he start to liven up, but it was just too little, too late at that point. I wish he had shown more passion throughout the course of the film. I was also a bit turned off by his home life. He has this almost psychotic child who he and his wife (played by Jaimie Alexander) don't even seem to bother trying to handle. It was a bit off putting, and the fact that he wasn't actually played by a child was even more odd. Also, I was excited to see Jaimie Alexander in this movie, but then disappointed by how she was so underutilized. Even Cara Delevingne, who was also underutilized, had a better role here. And we even get a little bit of Johnny Depp doing what he does best with another quirky, and somewhat intriguing character. The other two main stars in this film were Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton as Nicola Six and Samson Young. I actually liked both of their performances here, outside of some bad dialogue. I felt for these characters. I was interested in seeing their stories unfold, even if it was a bit predictable. They had great chemistry with one another, especially during the scenes where they're just hanging out talking. It was refreshing to see them like this, in non-sexual situations, as most of the movie was centered around sexuality. And speaking of the sexuality in this film, I was pleasantly surprised that it really didn't feel tasteless to me. It never got overly gratuitous, which can be difficult in a film like this. One of the things I loved about this film, however, was the score. The jazz noir music was a perfectly beautiful fit, which set the tone in a way that only music can. Every time those saxophone notes would hit, it locked me in. I'd love to see the film noir genre have a renaissance, bringing with it this infectious style of music. Overall, I feel London Fields was a bit of a misstep, failing to live up to its full potential. It has some redeeming qualities, but I just wish it had had a stronger structure, and a bit more character development. If the premise and/or cast intrigues you at all, go see the film. Judge for yourself.",-1

1.0,"Monday, January 6, 2013 (2010) The Nutcracker: The Untold Story FAMILY/ FANTASY/ MUSICAL Watched this dud on 2D and it's quite bad. I had never seen a Nutcracker movie nor a cartoon before but this one is not encouraging. Adapted into the screenplay and directed by Andrey Konchalovskiy starring Elle Fanning as little girl Mary magically conversing with a talking woodened nutcracker given by her harmless eccentric uncle Albert played by Nathan Lane who unknowingly didn't know that it was an actual prince who turned into a nutcracker. Mary then finds out that it was an army of talking rats with one of them turning the prince into the Nutcracker whose real intentions was planning to make the prince's people unhappy by taking over his reign and ridding the area's toys by burning them up, for the rest of the movie dwells on this as Mary and her friends go against the rat people lead by the rat king played by John Turturro. Filmed in such uninspiring fashion, there's truly nothing magical about this version for some of the major problems has to with the singing which some sounded like they need rehearsal and are sometimes out of synch. Other scenes that I had trouble with regards Uncle Albert blatantly playing a piano and then suddenly once he stops playing so that he can join singing with the other two kids. Either the piano that he left from or some other piano started to take over. It's like the piano started to play on it's own when there isn't a contraption in sight or anything that's making it do that, or that there's another magical piano I don't know about. The next scene is when the nutcracker comes to life in the bedroom where Mary happens to sleep at, and it makes a loud noise by jumping down onto some pillows- loud enough for the housemaid to hear it from another room and she comes in and investigate it before leaving again except that I was very baffled why the noise wasn't loud enough to wake her irritating little brother who also sleeps in the same room as she does. One more baffling thing is when Mary meets the prince as a human being for the very first time and they started skating together on one of the Nutcracker's catchy songs except that the audience never saw anyone carrying any skates around like it was automatically expected to happened. And then once the prince and Mary stopped dancing together on their skates who they immediately started running up into a nearby staircase they started walking around in shoes again like the skates they were wearing never existed in the first place. It was almost like those stop motion animations since it was never shown how the two characters ever had time to take any of the skates off, or that the magical snow fairy ever used her wand to make them disappear. All these problems I had listed all occurred in the first 20 or 30 minutes into watching this film. For it also seemed like the director Andrey Konchalovskiy assumed that because the general audience are already aware about ""The Nutcracker"" story that the audience would overlook many impossibilities that goes against science. It shouldn't be called ""The Nutcracker: The Untold Story"" it should've been called ""The Nutcracker: The Version That Doesn't Make Any Sense"" or ""The Nutcracker: The Version That Defied Science"". 1/2 star out of 4",-1
2.5,"Not great for people that know the actually story by ETA Hoffman, or want a movie with an ending. Acting is decent, plot is messed up, there are random musical numbers (as in singing), and the ending is anti-climatic and rather awkward. Special effects are good though, and the beginning of the movie is much better than the middle and end. Note for the movie makers though: try to make the Nutcracker look like a nutcracker, and not a puppet-like doll.",-1

It gets another plus for the tasteful, well-managed use of CGI for nothing more than what it's needed for. Unfortunately, the ending they chose to go with feels tacked-on at the last minute, as it creates a few plot holes, though you won't notice them unless you're really paying attention.",0

1.0,Crap on a cracker in 3D!,-1
3.5,"I have never seen any classic Nutcracker films or ballets, and I never read the story, and I never plan to. But then I came across this infamous box-office bomb. I was uninterested at first, but then I saw that John Turturro played the villain. Now that was very interesting. I love his flamboyancy and thick Boston accent, so any movie he's in will have me interested. So I checked out the trailer, and my god, did it look cool. There were giant helicopters with long robotic legs, motorcycles with gatelling guns on them, and some badass looking rat-humans. And I got exited as heck. I thought it was going to be a groundbreaking epic. I got it on Blu-ray and watched it on my flat-screen TV, and it looked awesome. But I must say, I don't think it quite achieved the epic status it strained for. I mean, not to say it isn't good, but it's very muddled. First off, it's not as fluffy and whimsical as the poster suggests, and it's not quite as epic and adventurous as the trailer suggests. It does have some elements of both, but they're handled very unevenly. Basically, the film just doesn't know what it wants to be or who it's aiming at. When they're in the human world, everything is all dumbed-down and childish, but when they enter Ratworld, things get creepy, dank, and darkly humorous. Plus, NC himself is VERY annoying, with his high-pitched, scratchy voice and strange hat, which is unfortunate, because his visual effects are pretty cool. The rest of the acting is average at best, but the best performances come from Turturro as the evil Rat King and Nathan Lane as Uncle Albert (who I guess is supposed to be Albert Einstein for some reason). They both appear to be having enormous fun in their roles, and I really think they hit the note. Elle Fanning and Charlie Rowe are not the best, but you can definitely see that they're trying, and plus, they're just kids (I didn't see Shirley Temple bringing home any Oscars). On top of that, the dialogue is rather cheesy, a bit too funny when it should be serious and a bit too strange when it should be funny. The songwriting is also fairly mediocre, especially the ones tied on to Tchaikovsky's instrumental songs. The only songs that I really enjoyed were the Rat King's songs, which were delightfully creepy and humorous. So the film is really roller-coaster in terms of quality. The big thing about this movie that everybody seemed to hate was the fact that it showed very little resemblance of a ballet, and that it was far too dark for something as whimsical and sweet as The Nutcracker. For me, however, those are the film's two biggest selling points. I hate ballets more that life itself, and if there were much more than a few brief dance scenes in the movie, I'd probably hang myself. And it is indeed quite dark, with the Rat King's soldiers bearing striking similarities to Nazis, and all the pictures of crying children hanging up on his wall, and a particularly infamous scene where he electrocutes his pet shark just for the heck of it. But I thought this all added to the atmosphere of the film, which was very nice. The special effects, production design and makeup were just amazing to look at, and they really brought some life into the feel of the story. So in the end, this movie is not perfect, but at least it's beautifully filmed and has a decent story. It certainly wasn't the enormous turkey that the critics called it, but I can't say that it's for everyone.",0

1.0,"Terrible, incredibly bad, simply god-awful, nonsensical, needlessly absurd. This is a film that features Nazi rats, toy burning, awful musical numbers set to the music from the actual Nutcracker ballet (one of which is devoted entirely to Einstein's theory of relativity), shoe-horned references to famous psychologists, and Albert Einstein in a supporting role. John Turturro and Frances de la Tour are eye-gougingly bad as the rat king and queen. You know it's bad when you begin to miss Nathan Lane's Albert Einstein, who is the sole source of magic and whimsy in this turd. Dark, ugly, and nihilistic, this is easily the worst Christmas film i have seen so far, in fact it's actually kind of depressing how dark and grey this film is. This film sucks, but once you start watching it's so bad that you can't tear your eyes away....faint praise indeed.",-1

The director is Russian Andrei Konchalovsky who did a mini-series of the Odyssey with Armand Assante and other worthies that I liked. His brother is Nikita Mikhalkov who made the great Burnt by the Sun. Their father was a famous poet Sergei Mikhalkov, who (three times!) wrote lyrics to his country's national anthem, two different sets of lyrics used for the Soviet national anthem, and the current lyrics of the Russian national anthem. None of this helps the movie, which is dark and grotesque, but then I like such things.",0

2.5,"The Nutcracker 3D is one of the strangest cocktails I've seen in a long time. It's technically a kids adventure story, yet it eventually becomes, of all things, a striking Holocaust parable. Yet during the shockingly vivid second act, the film still finds time to deal with a Peter Pan-like subplot about how adults eventually outgrow their childish pursuits. The problem with the film is not-so-much that it's bad (it's not), but that I have no idea what audience it was made for. The first act of the story follows what I presume is a pretty traditional Nutcracker story (it's been ages since I saw the play, I was actually one of the Sugerplum Fairies in Kindergarten). It's 1920s Vienna and Young Mary (Elle Fanning) lives with her brother Max (Aaron Michael Drozin) in a house filled with everything but friends. Their parents (Richard E. Grant and Yuliya Vysotskaya) have left them on Christmas night, heading off to a social function and leaving them in the care of their charming and eccentric uncle Albert (Nathan Lane). Albert gives Mary a very special present, a nutcracker shaped like a toy soldier. Sure enough, the wooden toy (Charlie Rowe) quickly comes to life and whisks Mary away on a seemingly charming little adventure where toys have human forms and the world is to scale of a small toy. So far, so good right? But about forty minutes into the picture, we meet the Rat King (John Turturro, looking and acting exactly like Jonathan Pryce). And, quite frankly, he's Hitler, right down to his grand plan to ethnically cleanse the population so that only rats remain. His rat soldiers? Goose-stepping soldiers dressed in somewhat generic Nazi uniforms. The next act of the picture deals with stark explicitness in the Rat King's desire to hunt down the rebellious Prince, who was turned into a nutcracker as a way to destroy morale amidst the rebellion. We see giant factories that keep the sky drenched in black smoke, we see dissidents being captured and tossed into forced labor camps, we even see countless moments of children being forced to give up their toys as said play items are tossed into giant fire pits. No one gets tattoos on their arms, no one is forced to wear yellow stars on their jacket, and (I promise...) no one gets stripped naked and led into gas chambers, but the implications are pretty obvious for anyone with even a token knowledge of 20th century history. That this seemingly innocuous family picture is in fact a pretty grim survival story with obvious historical relevance is of course not a flaw. I've certainly championed films aimed at kids that dare to be socially relevant, scary, and dramatic. And it certainly is all three. The film's second and third act is paced like a genuine thriller, with spirited chases, miraculous escapes, and tensely-edited action sequences. And the film does not sugarcoat the emotional impact of these events on our heroes. There is a nice moment where Max is temporarily seduced by the Rat King's promises of power. When he realizes what he's supporting, young Drozen reacts with a genuine horror that resonates. And while (slight spoiler) there is a bare minimum of out-and-out violence in the picture, Turturro plays his Rat King as if he were playing a deadly-serious super-villain. The Rat King makes it perfectly clear that his ultimate ambition is lethal purification ('Ratification') of the world (the burning of the toys throughout the picture allows the picture to symbolize mass murder without actually producing a body count). Point being, this movie is rated PG for a reason. Okay, aside from the unexpectedly dark themes, how is the movie? It's, well, okay. The film drags a bit in the second act and becomes a bit rushed in the third, but the technical credits are all pretty solid and the actors all take this material very seriously. Richard E. Grant and Nathan Lane share a fine moment around the halfway mark where they reminisce about their childhoods (by the way, Uncle Albert sings a song pretty early on concerning the theory of relevant, in case there is any confusion as to Albert's last name). Elle Fanning gives an engaging performance, which compensates for the wooden (sorry) work of Charlie Rowe. Rowe isn't bad per se, it's just that his Nutcracker Prince is more a symbol than a genuine character. Turturro delivers the evil goods, as expected. The Nutcracker 3D is a bizarre concoction, mixing childish fantasy with real-world horrors in a way that almost works. I wish the film had spent more time on character and less on frenetic action, but it's certainly a unique bit of 'family filmmaking' in a season dominated by animated films and CGI-infused adaptations of classic cartoons. The film gets points for its ambition, as well as its willingness to risk alienating parents even if their kids are unaware of the broader implications of the story being told. As for the 3D, it wasn't shot in 3D, it doesn't really benefit from the 3D, so see it in 2D if it's available. For those who want something to take their family to over the Thanksgiving holiday that isn't animated, The Nutcracker 3D serves its purpose. Just make sure to take note of the whole 'parental guidance suggested' bit.",-1
3.0,"V√©ritable bombe au box-office am√©ricain (mais succ√®s inattendu en Russie), cette nouvelle adaptation du ballet de Tcha√Økowsky a √©galement √©t√© proprement √©trill√©e par la critique am√©ricaine. On lui reprocha notamment son sc√©nario d√©sordonn√©, l'absence d'√©l√©ments relatifs au ballet et son univers sombre et effrayant, √† l'oppos√© de tout ce qui r√©git les films familiaux (mais apr√®s tout, le r√©alisateur Andrei Konchalovski a commenc√© sa carri√®re sous le communisme sovi√©tique et dieu sait que ces gens-l√† aimaient traumatiser les enfants, du moins quand ils n'√©taient pas occup√©s √† les manger). Tentons d'apporter un correctif √† cette mauvaise r√©putation : tout d'abord, quiconque a d√©j√† regard√© un film russe aura not√© que les proc√©d√©s narratifs sont diff√©rents et que l'ellipse y est fort fr√©quente. Ensuite, compte tenu de la cible enfantine, pourquoi aurait-il fallu √† tout prix rattacher le film au ballet d'origine ?

En ce qui concerne l'univers...une fois franchie l'√©tape des jouets qui s'animent dans leur maison de poup√©es et de l'escalade du sapin avec les angelots, les guirlandes, les princesses des neiges et tout un tas de trucs pour gentils chtits nenfants chr√©tiens, on d√©barque chez le peuple des rats du conte.

2.5,"I actually like some of the epically stupid ideas behind this (a more-futuristic version of the Nutcracker complete with jetpack-wearing Nazi rats), but the execution is terrible. If this concept was made for a teenage audience, in the style of Alice in Wonderland (and the horrible songs were cut out), maybe this could have been something. But for some reason, they tried to make it a childrens' film instead. This has no business being a kids' movie - toys are burned and get their heads yanked off, and the Rat King takes pictures of crying children and hangs them on his wall. What the heck is that about?! I get the feeling that the director had some sort of repressed childhood trauma...",-1
3.0,Aaaaah. Elle Fanning was good. The rats were terrifying. Horror/children's film?!,0
4.5,"People who disliked this film obviously never had a childhood moment not even had the christmas spirit in them and also dislike it because they will never or ever will have a chance to experience the magic. The dislike people should be called RATS! And stay in RAT LAND forever. I know it sounds like a metaphor (or whatever you say or write it, don't care), but I liked it. I have seen the Barbie version when I was a kid, saw the ballet version with amazing circus effects, also many versions on TV and this one was so full packed of emotions, I even cried because I still have good childhood memories and I know a NC is still outhere wanting to be found. ""Dreams are real if you fight for them and make them real"". Plot: As in the original version but adapted by the screen-writter (the director just direct orders and has incredible ideas, but the whole concept was already done before we all know that. Anyway, want to know more of a director, screen-writter or crew? Study acting and 7th Arts). Anyway, like I was writing, like in the original but adapted, the 9 yrs old Mary, wants a family christmas, but first the family must encourage themselves and tell secrets to save christmas (the spirit). The same day, her uncle Albert apears with a house and the toy NC. In the night, they come to life and make Mary go to her dreamland. How this will end? We al know the ending and the story itself. Is very surreal and magical. I know the action part could be gone, but I think it was so well done, I did not care at all. So stars for the creativity on the CGI team, the crew, everyone! Acting: Elle Fanning did amazing job as Mary. I have seen so many films of this girl, I think she wil evolve to be as great as her sister, Dakota Fanning. She has a promising future (see SUPER 8). Aaron as the brother of Mary was also incredible and stunning. This kids nailed very well their roles. Frances (knew I saw her in the Potter films) was so great, I could not stop laughing of happiness. The rest of the cast was amazing also, even the RATS! So stars for everyones effort. I think that when a cast had fun in the set, it was worth to do a film, a play or a music video. Acting Bring Smiles. Music: BEST PART EVAR! (the instrumental versions duh are still the best ones and if you saw the movie in mexican accent, I must admit the songs translated to that spanish accent was not good enough, no offence made). No matter the language or accent you will still enjoy the movie, but let the music be in it's original face! Anyway, the musicians did an awesome job , so stars for them all. To end this fantastic review, 4 & a half stars of 5. Enjoy and HASTA LA PROXIMA AMIGOS/AS! CHAO! BLESS YOU ALL!!!",1
1.5,"Mmmm...not very good. This really struck me as if it was written and directed by a complete novice. The performers, many of whom are otherwise talented, all seem like bad actors.

1.5,"(1 1/2 Stars) (2D DVD version) The Nutcracker in 3D, aka The Nutcracker: The Untold Story, is bizarre. It has great production design and some imagination, but it's a certified trainwreck. Something is off with the dialogue, the CG is second-rate, and there's strange imagery to the holocaust and the Third Reich... Merry Christmas, kids! It's a big budget disaster, like the Christmas version of Battlefield Earth! Sadly, it's not an enjoyable disaster, because even with its good-looking production design, it drags. I don't think the actors are going to keep this on their resumes; John Turturro plays the evil Rat King, who looks like David Bowie if he mated with a Who from Whoville. Nathan Lane plays Albert Einstein, but his wig makes him look more like a white Don King. It's a musical, but all of the songs are forgettable, which is sad because the music in the original Nutcracker ballet is universally recognizable. Plus, among the dozens of odd things in the film, there are rat people on jet-packs... this may sound stupid enough for a viewing, but it's not. The Nutcracker: The Untold Story is really sad.",-1

1.0,"Russian filmmaker, Andrey Konchalovskiy, has taken Tchaikovsky's timeless, holiday-themed ballet, The Nutcracker (Suite), and done the IMPOSSIBLE with it -- he has turned it into a nightmare (while keeping the same story audiences around the world know)! The heart of the story has remained the same here -- in this version we have nine-year-old Mary (Elle Fanning - Somewhere, Super 8, ... Benjamin Button) who has been given an enchanted nutcracker by her Uncle Albert (Nathan Lane - Mouse Hunt, The Birdcage, The Lion King) that comes to life at night and takes Mary to a magical world found inside her very own home. Poor dialogue, cheap costumes and subpar special effects (NC, the Nutcracker, has an awkward walk!!) don't help this version of the story. Also, by keeping some of the ballet's original musical compositions we are given a soundtrack that we know; but since other pieces of have been marred and ruined by trying to add juvenile sing-along-esque songs the ""flow"" of the music is disjointed and the story is disconnected (one scene has the late 1800's Mary dance and rock-it-out as if she was a pop princess from 2010!). In spite of all of these near-disasters, the death knell -- and what turns the film into a literal horror film -- is the humaniod rat-beings who's creepy and disturbing faces WILL horrify some viewers. The two-and-a-half minute trailer provides enough of a glimpse of these beasts to give one an idea of what I'm talking about! When angry or agitated, their faces can even morph into something more dastardly and evil and their teeth grow into fangs and their noses become snouts. I found the film both befuddling and shocking with these characters. The Rat King is the story's main villain ... but Friday the 13th's Jason isn't this frightening! This film version won't be winning-over any new fans ... and if this is someone's introduction to The Nutcracker, they might be scarred for life! This is a MUST to avoid!",-1

0.5,"I thought Burnt By The Sun 2 was the worst movie I've seen in a long while. It's not, though. It's the The Nutcracker in 3 D. The two Russian brothers are getting so burnt they crack, and go virtually nuts in the sun, and I don't see exactly why I have to suffer when I take my child to the movies the first day of the new year. If you don't remember your Freud from your Einstein, if the formula E = mc¬≤ has become somewhat hazy, or you are looking forward to constant mind games with character names (the Nutcracker, Sid, NC, the Prince, circle the right variant), go ahead and waste your ten bucks on this Christmas 'fairy tale'. I was looking forward to this for a year. Turns out, the trailer is the best thing connected with the whole project. My oh my. Andrei Konchalovsky has been dreaming about this a little longer. 20 years. That is a bit sad. Because the writing here is so tedious and exhausting, the editing so slack, the choreography and the painful dialogue so, well, full of pain, that it's difficult to understand what they've been doing with this all this time. Aha. The 3 D thing. This so-called Christmas movie is dark and exhausting. If you think you are in for some magic, forget it. The only thing you'll be dreaming about is the EXIT and the lights on the arrow luring you - run, run! Just when you get a glimpse of the finish line and you can go home to nurse your damaged brain cells, there goes another outmoded, silly plot twist. There are even two endings, the one in the dream land, the other in the real world. No wonder I had nightmares of explaining the dated Freudian hypotheses to a class of dropped jaws the previous night. I have a good intuition, it's just that I have to listen to it more often. I am not sure what the director is trying to do with these big names and theories, give the children a passing lecture or entertain the adults, but he fails at both. This is completely unsustainable for grown-ups, certainly nothing like the ambiguous, smart, multi-layered Pixar tales or even the breathlessly effortless Tangled. The film is ugly, period. I saw it in 2D, thank God, I cannot even begin to imagine the post-production 3D. The rats are ugly, period. They are not ugly cute, not ugly scary, not ugly peculiar or ugly tim-burton ugly. They are ugly disgusting, end of story. I felt like turning away from the screen, and I did. My child was virtually asleep. On our way home she asked me to retell the story for her and I was struggling with the overstuffed plot impossible to be digested for a confused almost-four-year-old. Vysotskaya, who is usually lovely, especially when she paces around her kitchen blabbering about French herbs, is unflattering both as Mum and the fairy, too made up as the first and sporting a ridiculous curly blonde wig as the second. The girl actress is cute, but nothing can save a movie that is so tedious I wanted to sleep but so loud I was unable to. It was dated 30 years ago. Thankfully rottentomatoes has not given it a single positive review. I feel a deep connection with anyone who had to endure it. Hats off, guys. Those who haven't seen The Nutcracker in 3 D I would urge to rerun Up or Toy Story 3, or even Shrek The 4rth. For those who had the misfortune, I have a few questions remained largely unanswered to me: What is up with the size of Mum's (Vysotskaya) clothes? What the hell happened to the shark? How do you like all the post-apocalyptic dystopian Nazi agenda - is this his answer to his little brother's last year 'masterpiece'? How are the drug/rat-poison references for you? And finally, in all honesty, was that a horror movie? I am off to see The Crazies, 2010, but I am sure it's not what my tonight's nightmare will be.",-1

0.5,"The Nutcracker In 3D is not The Nutcracker and well, it's not in 3D either. With the craze of 3D swarming the silver screen since the monster 2009 hit Avatar, the idea of Live-Action 3D blockbusters have been VERY attractive for every major studio in Hollywood, and it has caused a lot of mixed feelings about the new dimension. Now, before I go into the actual review of The Nutcracker In 3D, allow me to explain a few things about 3D and why some films look good where as others look... well, terrible. The Nutcracker In 3D is what's commonly referred to as a 'Post-Production Conversion' 3D film, which means that the idea of releasing the film in 3D either wasn't conceived before filming (ex. Clash of the Titans, The Last Airbender, and this month's Gulliver's Travels) or the film couldn't be filmed using 3D cameras (the underwater woes of Piranha 3D). This means, in short, that the 3D in these films end up looking very fake or not even there at all. Very few films so far have been filmed in stereoscopic 3D (the first being Avatar, followed by Resident Evil: Afterlife and this month's Tron: Legacy). If you couldn't guess already, Nutcracker is a post-production converted 3D mess. Originally filmed in 2007, the film struggled to find a studio to distribute it (and, as of writing this, I don't recall any studio logos preceding the film- after some research the distributor is Freestyle Releasing... never heard of 'em). Now for the review of the actual film itself. Where do I begin? Well, let's start with the plot. Adapted from the worldwide classic from Tchaikovsky, this movie decides to make a bold move for an adaptation... and that's to create a completely different product from the original and leave no trace behind. The film begins when little Mary (played by Elle Fanning) is disappointed with her Christmas Eve when her parents leave the house for the night and her Uncle Albert comes to the house. Now, I'd like you to prepare for the first insane bit of this story. Uncle Albert's (played by Nathan Lane) full name is Albert Einstein. Yes, THE Albert Einstein. I can honestly say I have absolutely no idea what he's doing in the film, except to sing a bit and give Mary and her brother Max the gifts that set off the adventure. Mary receives a dollhouse with some toys and the Nutcracker, and that's when Einstein tells the story of the Nutcracker. From there, the story takes off into something only a truly sick person would create: a children's film involving mass genocide, Nazi Rats, brutal violence and very dark undertones. The film tries to make something magical in the tune of The Polar Express, but instead creates something truly twisted and just plain weird. The acting wasn't the worst part of the film, thank goodness. The worst part might have been the songs that were sung by the various actors in the film. Basically the fomula for the soundtrack was SONG FROM NUTCRACKER BALLET + IRRELEVANT LYRICS ABOUT SCIENCE OR DICTATORSHIP = SONG SUNG BY JOHN TUTURRO OR NATHAN LANE. And yet, I feel as though this film will have some sort of cult following, but not a big enough one to keep the film afloat in DVD sales, let alone keep it in the top 35 Box Office (yes, it's 35th this week in the Box Office) The film has made $150,000 back in two weeks of its release trying to make back its 90 million dollar budget. With those numbers, I'm 1 of about 20,000 people who has seen the movie.",-1

0.5,"If you have fond childhood memories of the perennial Christmas fairytale The Nutcracker, long-admired for its ability to usher in the holiday spirit and make ballet accessible for young audiences everywhere, prepare to be absolutely horrified. Perhaps it was the allure of a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the cryptic trailer that looks more like Transformers 3 than a quaint holiday classic, or the remarkable ability for a Christmas film budgeted at $90 million and requiring three years of development to bring in only $65,000 in its opening weekend before getting unceremoniously pulled from most theaters after only a week of release -- nothing was going to keep me from joining the cursed few to see ""The Nutcracker in 3D"". Pay attention to the details here, because it's easy to get lost. The film centers on Albert Einstein -- yes, THAT Albert Einstein (played here by Nathan Lane) -- and his family in 1920's Vienna as they're gearing up for the Christmas holiday. Why exactly Einstein is celebrating Christmas or why his niece and nephew are blond-haired, blue-eyed Austrians or why he's even in The Nutcracker at all, it's best to just shrug and let those details slide, because that's about as close to logic as the story gets. Being the great uncle that he is, however, Einstein has brought presents: a wooden Nutcracker soldier and a giant dollhouse filled with a few of the Nutcracker's friends: an obese clown, a Jamaican drummer boy and an escapee from Planet of the Apes who likes to dress in herringbone suits and smoke cigars. Einstein's niece, Mary (Elle Fanning, whose primary claim to fame is being less annoying than her older sister Dakota), takes a particular liking to the Nutcracker doll who miraculously comes alive and takes her with him into his magical, mystical world somewhere inside her Christmas tree, where we learn that he's actually a young, human prince who's been cursed to take the form of a doll and banished from his kingdom by the evil Rat King (actually, half human/half rat). But here's where it gets weird. The Rat King (John Turturro) has taken over the prince's city and transformed it into an autocratic state overrun by rat-faced soldiers enforcing a strict purification policy (referred to as Ratification), that bears more than a coincidental resemblance to Hitler's Germany, if only Nazis had navigated around in jetpacks and hybrid-helicopters/Walker robots from The Empire Strikes Back, as these soldiers do. The city's horrified populace is kept hostage by the heavily armed, rat-faced regime and forced to live under a dark cloud that's fed by the smokestacks of crematoriums constructed to burn children's toys. Feeling that Christmas spirit yet? Of course, it's ultimately up to Mary and her toy cohorts to defeat the Rat King and liberate the prince's kingdom, which, of course, they do. But, I'm thinking that ominous cloud wasn't composed of burnt embers of doll stuffing at all -- it was peyote and the makers of The Nutcracker in 3D were breathing it in the entire time they were filming this disaster. It's not all doom and gloom however. Some of Tchaikovsky's original melodies manage to survive (alas, without the dancing), only to be overlain with lyrics written by Oscar-winner Tim Rice (Evita, The Lion King), in half a dozen musical numbers that range from a baffling, unnecessary attempt to explain to kids Einstein's Theory of Relativity to one that ends with the electrocution of a great white shark... in a giant fish tank... in 1920's Vienna. I couldn't make this stuff up if I tried, folks. The distributors of this film should be absolutely ashamed of themselves, if not criminally prosecuted, for marketing this as children's fare. Adding machine guns, threats of cutting off a child's fingers, thinly veiled allegory to mass genocide and an actual decapitation of one of the characters -- in 3D nonetheless -- gives new definition to the term ""inappropriate"". It all manages to somehow glide through with a PG rating, but there were two groups of children in the theater for my screening and neither made it past the first hour. The Nutcracker in 3D is more a mash-up of Alice in Wonderland and Schindler's List than an adaptation of its namesake ballet. But, it reminds me most of the vastly superior, recent fairytale adaptation, The Golden Compass. And that film was horrible. The biggest winner in all of this is the filmmakers of Sex and the City 2. Until now, they had an absolute lock on Worst Film of 2010. But it seems their Christmas present has come early in the form of The Nutcracker in 3D.",-1

I think what most people didn't like about the film was its generally lacklustre acting and poor script but that being said it does have an interesting mystery and sports some beautiful camera work in a few scenes and generally a very good plot. The film is not a horror film in my opinion, almost everyone's biggest problem with the film was what made it stand out to me, which was that there weren't any real scares and the antagonist is underdeveloped and has no horror climax, when in fact the whole premise of the film is about a woman who clearly has psychotic depression and the entire film is set from the perspective of her mind warped by grief. It's not difficult to pick it out relatively early in the film but a movie about the mind of a woman suffering from psychosis I found was very riveting with lots of great commentary about mental illness. Watch absolutely any scene in the film which alludes to horror and you can see the effort the filmmakers put in to skew the perception of the events unfolding as a part of an ultimately well rounded narrative.",1

Should have just hired someone less attractive if that is what you were after. This is one of those movies that can't decide whether it wants to actually be a ghost story or instead a look into the mind of a mentally unstable woman. Since she's the only one who can see the ghosts, it all might be in her head. This really undermines any tension that was trying to be built as well as taking any possible scares right out of the movie. The story is not that interesting to begin with, then you get the wishy-washy ghost story/mentally deranged tangle and you wind up with a movie that is lousy but has a great looking lead buried underneath the hair that forever hangs in her face and the clothes that cover everything. What a shame.",-1
1.0,"A real disappointment. The movie is a bad mashing up of real horrors - the death of an infant, the mistreatment of the disabled - with the usual big old haunted house that a family from the City moves. The hauntings are so cliched. The plot holes are huge - such as that Beckinsale, playing an architect, wouldn't have notice much earlier on that there was an extra room in the house with a huge round window that is smack dab on front of the house! Her performance swings between wooden and overwrought. Mel Raido's Dave is cringe inducing as a nebbishy, annoying lay-about. And the kid needs a haircut - desperately.

Dana's story is actually more interesting than the ghost story, but it too is used as a plot device for scares, making the end result feel indeterminate and... disappointing.",-1

0.5,"TLDR: complete garbage. This movie sucked complete ass. Shot in the style of some 4th year film student with a clunky indie feel, except the student never actually learned what makes a film work and only seems to follow that studious formulaic process in hopes of pretentiously impressing the teacher for a grade. It's like a comedian that boils every joke down to the base elements via a scientific process, like South Park's Funnybot, without actually knowing what's funny. Too many times does it sabotage itself by showing too much of the supernatural stuff to be taken at face value, thereby ruining the audience's suspension of disbelief. 87% of the film shows what *could* be happening if the film decided to continue in a certain direction down the rails of the plot, only to derail the train, sweep it all up, and replant it on the track five minutes back. Instead of a slick plot device hoping to confuse the audience and have them relate to the protagonist's mental health issues it falls completely flat and executes in a manner that leaves you feeling like the director didn't know which direction to take in the end and just left a big wad of mashed together nonsense in for the final cut. Save your time and money. I watched it on Netflix and I STILL want my money back.",-1
1.5,"Sometimes there's films that, really, I don't even know how to begin their review. It doesn't really connect to any point I want to make prior to the actual review itself nor do they really do anything outstanding that it makes reviewing them easy. Let's just get this out of the way, there's absolutely nothing that this movie does well. Absolutely nothing. I suppose you could say that Kate Beckinsale, despite having a poorly developed character, gives a solid performance. And that's certainly a very valid point, but Kate Beckinsale's performance exists outside of everything else that happens in the film. Kate is solid in spite of everything else that is happening around her. I get the film's concept and its inspiration in trying to tell this story. Kate is a mother whose baby died, in an accident, the year prior to the film's events. Dana (Beckinsale's character) is overcome with grief, understandably. The family then decides to move away from the hustle and bustle of the city to a more isolated house in the country so Dana, hopefully, can move on from the accident and get her life back on track. Dana, who's also an architect, decides to renovate the house as having a project might help her deal with her issues. Dana, while exploring her house, finds this room up in the attic that isn't in any of the blueprints and has a chifforobe in front of the entrance. The door, also, only locks from the outside. Dana has some strange experiences in this room, like being locked inside it and believing that she was trapped in there for hours. She tries to find out the history behind this room and is told that this room, called a disappointments room creatively enough, were built for children with special needs or deformities to be confined to. They would put this children in this room to keep them from embarrassing the rest of the family. Conceptually speaking, the film is somewhat intriguing. Like just from a basic point of view. If you were to tell me the basic idea of finding out what happened in this 'disappointment room' in the past and the dark story behind this room, then I would have though that that was a decent concept. It's not a great concept, and it's not really that different from other films that have explored similar subjects in places like insane asylums, but it could have been decent. Sadly, however, the film just wastes the idea. Firstly, this isn't really a horror movie. I'd complain about jump scares, but the fact is that there aren't any. There's a few scenes where you see figures walking in front of the camera, but I wouldn't call those scares. I would call that the set-up. Yet the scares never actually came. I get the idea behind focusing so much of the film on Dana's emotional and mental issues. It calls into question everything she says, even though she's telling the truth. But the film's insistence on focusing on that really leaves no room to develop an actually scary story about a father, whose shame of his daughter was so great, that he actually killed her with a hammer to the face. I think the film should have juxtaposed that with Dana's own issues, she feels like she's a terrible mother. And, maybe, the film was meant to juxtapose those two elements but, if they were, they did an awful job of it. They really fucking did. Characters are introduced to set up potential subplots that aren't actually ever paid off on. The acting is fine, but it doesn't really matter when the script they're servicing is so much of nothing. The narrative escalates to a point where Dana literally loses her shit at this dinner party, that just so happens to take place the same day that her daughter (the one who died) was born. She destroys everything around her, all the plates, vases, glasses, etc. A few minutes later, she goes into her son's room and she sees the father (the one who murdered his daughter) standing over her son's bed. She proceeds to take a hammer to this guy's face. When Dana's husband comes in, all he sees is Dana hammering a pillow right next to her son's body. The kid is obviously distraught. But David, the kid's father, manages to convince him that it was just a nightmare (this kid must be some sort of moron). Dana and David then have a conversation about what she's feeling and then they just leave the house. And that's how the movie ends. Really. Oh, of course, there's the typical 'it's not really over' bullshit. But, since they've already left the house, it's not like it matters. Talk about an anticlimactic ending. All that ""story"" for, literally, an ending that gives you next to no satisfaction. It felt flat like a motherfucker. So, yea, this movie was kind of bad. It's not really a horror movie, it lacks a plot that makes use of the various elements that are at play here, it doesn't really build to anything and the ending is completely anticlimactic. The acting may be decent, but there's no real reason to care about any of the characters. If it wasn't obvious, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this movie. There's certainly worse films out there (like Sammo Hung's The Bodyguard, which I reviewed a few days ago), but this one just won't do anything for most of you. And for those of you that do find something to like here, please tell me who your weed supplier is.",-1
0.5,Disappointments movie.,-1
1.0,"The Disappointments Room is a disappointment itself. A little interesting plot fully ruined by its lame execution, where, it seems that the actors' efforts we're put into trash. I personally don't think that the problems entirely lies on its director, D.J. Caruso, where he's proven that he's also good at some action-thriller flicks like Eagle Eye (2008) and xXx: Return Of Xander Cage (2016 / 2017). The biggest chunk of failure in this movie is the limited budget paired with an ambitious story, a tale that could've been deeper with a more frightening house, like a gothic-type-mansion-like and a more believable threat. Kate Beckinsale, as we all know, is a well established actress, her skills are unquestionable and we are complacent on how the other actors performed as well, but what we can all see are wasted efforts all around. The Disappointments Room has its good actors and potentials to be a terrifying psychological thriller but the poorly written script and dull story causes this horror a forgettable-no-scare-horror-film.",-1

But after 45 minutes or so, it was just people moving around the house. I watched it until the end just to see if there was a surprise twist, but there wasn't.

I won't give you the windows to wall synopsis here (that's available on google), but the gist of it is marine biologist/shark expert Kate is dealing with some pretty heavy guilt surrounding the death of her colleague and friend and ends up pushing her limits by taking an ill-fated trip to Shark Alley. I would've loved to see more discussion of trauma at the beginning of the film when we're learning about Kate, but that's just me! Something else to note is that a good chunk of the movie is filmed at night, meaning the screen is quite dark, limiting visibility. Dark Tide isn't going to be your cup of tea if you just want a short, entertaining cult shark film with all the cheap CGI and gore, but if you find sharks just super fascinating and would be satisfied to see lots of clips of them swimming around (super majesticly in my opinion) with Kate and the other characters, then look no further! I really liked it, but you'll just have to watch for yourself to find out if you do too.",1
0.5,Poor acting and an even poorer plot! Tries to be clever by using footage of real sharks but the real sharks are the only thing to get any pass marks in this film. The attack scenes are poorly shot and you dont even care about any of the characters as they are all awful. I love a good shark movie and can even get enjoyment out of the bad B movie one now and again but this is hands down the worst shark film I have ever seen - 100% avoid!,-1
4.0,"I love shark films and this one does a nice job of showing them in their natural habitat as well as what they're capable of. I've watched horror films my whole life and it's ONLY shark films that have ever given me the heebie-jeebies. The dangerous situation Berry's character puts the other characters into is unprofessional and unforgivable, and yet it's never addressed - I hate that in films.",1
1.0,"Dear God this is a boring and depressing movie! In all honesty I didn't even watch the last twenty minutes because I couldn't take it one more minute, even after watching most of it and that meaning I wouldn't know what happened. At that point I couldn't have cared less if they all got eaten by sharks, I really didn't care. I just needed it to stop. It is surprising to me that Halle Berry would be in such an awful film but here we are and man is it awful!!",-1
0.5,"I don't usually write bad reviews, but this movie has GOT to be an exception! This is perhaps one of the worse movies I have ever seen in my life! The acting on this movie made me want to rip out my eyeballs, slather them with STEAK sauce and EAT THEM JUST so I can never see this movie again! This movie is AWFUL! I don't say that lightly either! I love Halle Berry, but I don't EVER want to see her in something like this again! The plot was dumb! The effects were OK! The acting was AWFUL! AWFUL! AWFUL! Did anyone preview this before it was released? Did ANY executive actually think it was good? What was the director thinking? This movie was so bad that I can't even believe that someone edited this and said ""YEAH! We have a hit!"". NO! This movie literally has NO direction! It is like watching someone go to the bathroom. I am watching this on YouTube. I think it is even too bad for YouTube! It isn't a B move. It isn't even a D movie! It is a Z MINUS movie! The ONE funny thing is watching Olivier Martinez be himself - a hothead ready to fight! Other than that, if someone ever made me watch this movie again, I would KILL them and I don't even mind saying that out loud! Thank god I am doing stuff while I am watching this! If I went to a theater, I would be REAL PISSED!",-1

0.5,"This movie pissed me off more then a dozen times. One, sharks do attack sometimes. Keyword sometimes, they DO NOT FUCKING ATTACK and come back to finish the job. I hate Hollywood for demonizing sharks and making them look like evil fish that just love human flesh. It is literally a fact that after an attack the shark never re-applies itself to finish the job. In the finale scenes where tommy gets his legs eaten and the dad is taken out of the water, in those weather conditions is absolutely absurd, and outright ridiculous! I have personally gone swimming with sharks. Not a great white, but many different breeds of sharks. This is utterly sickening and is upsetting, to a point where Hollywood should be completely shut down in the department of shark movies. This was so beyond what's realistic. They make these sharks out to be like some scyfy human flesh crazed killing machine. I felt as though the acting was goodd, had a good story line but was not thought or accurate at all when it comes to sharks. Overall I don't even give this one star due to the sheer shit respect the director and producer have for sharks.",-1
1.0,Absolutely utter shit.,-1
1.0,"Dark Tide is pretty bad. Some of the dialogue was terrible. ""You have beautiful eyebrows"" one of the lines from Ralph Brown to shark legend Halle Berry who has a Shark tour boat business! What! Olivier Martinez who later married Halle in real life I couldnt understand a word he was saying and no subtitles. He had absolute no chemistry with Halle Berry in the movie. Some subplot about South African poachers who you see get eaten by sharks was quickly forgotten and never mentioned by anyone. When the boat starts having hydraulic problems and impending bad weather approaching, Halle Berry decides to dive again with her irritating British shark tour customer played by Ralph. Last 25 minutes of the movie with the boat capsized you cant see bugger all. Lot of splashing about, a lot of shots of the sharks swimming about, you cant see who's who, to grainy, to dark. I had no idea who was alive or dead. What was with the shitty rainforest relaxation music last 20 mins whilst they are trying to survive the sharks. Ends with close up gazes of Berry , Martinez and the son of Ralph Brown who didnt seem to give a feck that his dad had been shark dinner looking up at the rescue helicopter. Complete dogshit.

4.5,"My girlfriend and I, who are huge fan's of Discovery Channels yearly Shark Week, watched this movie Dark Tide despite all the bad reviews.. and our shark instincts were dead-on! This is actually the best Hollywood movie to ever come out on sharks! Every other movie about sharks, from Jaws to all the other silly horror flicks about sharks to the even sillier Sharknado, #1) don't show any real sharks (just fake ones) whereas this Film shows real breath-taking sharks in the open ocean, & #2) all the other shark movies just perpetuate the same misconceptions about sharks, whereas this is like an episode of Discovery's Shark Week, except its delivered from within a Film plot starring Halle Berry and her BF Olivier Martinez (both of whom do a good job). In addition, all the reviewers are completely ignorant to what this movie is really about... they're obviously not Shark Week fans, because if they were, they would realize that this movie Dark Tide is really about the amazingly spiritual & break-thru shark research done by Mike Rutzen who is also known as the Sharkman, (whom this movie credits at the end) who on one of the best episodes of Shark Week a couple years ago showed that these apex predators also are creatures that need to give & receive nurture & affection; and he even not just swims but also plays and like literally is cuddled by many different species of ""deadly"" sharks, including Great Whites, like as if they were cats or dogs snuggling next to their human owners. So this movie is loosely based on Mike Rutzen (his videos actually way supercede this movie), a true scientist and biologist and nature-lover (at least in the opinion of this scientist and human M.D. trauma surgeon;)",1

Halle Berry is still in her physical prime and works with what she has. The shark footage is pretty cool at times. However, the real action doesn't come until the last act, and even there, it's disappointing. ""Dark Tide"" drags and lacks the imagination and suspense one would find in movies like ""Open Water"" and ""The Reef."" It also doesn't help that one of the characters is downright unlikeable. It's more unfortunate for Halle Berry, who can't seem to ever top her standing ovation-worthy, Oscar-winning performance in ""Monster's Ball.""",-1

But in the last decade there's been a few good tries, most notably, Chris Kentis' nerve-wrecking Open Water and The Reef. Dark Tide suffers from a lengthier running time than actually necessary, a sleep-walking appearance by Martinez and a low-budget (the latter is kind if debatable as it adds to a surprising sense of realism). It has its merits. The underwater shots are brilliant and look and feel real. The characters are decent enough with veteran Ralph Brown being the best of the bunch as the super annoying millionaire Brady and the climax is agreeably tensed.

3.0,"In Shark Alley, courage runs deep Very decent good movie! I liked Dark Tide mainly because of it's camera work and portrayal of the Great White shark. The underwater camera work appeared to be original and was impressive in terms of continuity, unlike most shark films where footage is borrowed from a documentary and pasted in. The behavior of the sharks is also more realistic, showing that people with experience can swim with them outside the cage and not be attacked. The action is great there is some emotional depth between the two main protagonists and to me it seemed like a very enjoyable film. Kate is a shark expert whose business has been failing since a shark attack killed a fellow diver under her command. Once dubbed ""the shark whisperer,"" Kate is haunted by the memory of the attack and unable to get back into the water. With bills piling up and the bank about to foreclose on Kate's boat, Kate's ex-boyfriend Jeff presents her with a lucrative opportunity to lead a thrill-seeking millionaire businessman on a dangerous shark dive - outside the cage.

2.0,"Great and realistic shots of sharks, but the movie is amiss because it fails to create the suspense it should have. I don't think the script was strong enough, or was it the direction that failed to capture the thrill it should have, hard to pick. The cast was certainly good enough and the shooting of the sharks was so good I doubt anyone can complain about that. We can see how fake the famous 'Jaws' sharks were when we see this movie, however the suspense of the Spielberg flick was unmistakable, whereas there is virtually no suspense here. The musical score of Jaws played a big part in the suspense building while the score of this movies just does not work for me, and I mean not one bit. I was impressed with the camera work underwater; it is as close to documentary movies on the subject of swimming with great white sharks as I've seen. However, it is not a documentary and as a thriller action movie it deserves the poor all around ratings I've noted at the various sources I usually check. To make my point: There is a scene almost midway, perhaps a little earlier, when a trio of young guys go diving at night and appear to be killed one by one by what we can only presume are sharks; that scene is completely unrelated to the rest of the movie, it comes out of nowhere and leads to the same place. We never see the shark(s). This was amateurish stuff and is a clue to what the rest of the movie had in store. I was disappointed that the movie wasted talent like Halle Bery, Olivier Martinez and Ralph Brown; they deserved better and I'll do my best to forget they were in this movie.",-1

1.5,"‚òÖ‚òÖ (out of four) An awkward thriller that sinks rather than swins. When the sharks are on the screen, it is somewhat engaging, but as soon as the cameras head out of the water and focus on the humans, it becomes a bore. Halle Berry is an expert on sharks and living in South Africa. Following a tragic accident where friends were killed by the sharks, she takes a job as a boat tour guide. Her estranged husband (Olivier Martinez) offers to help her out of her debt problems. A wealthy businessman wants to pay big bucks to swim with sharks. Things turn violent quickly as the group heads out on the water. The drama is pretty uninteresting and the footage of the sharks are impressive, but would be more at home on TV for ""Shark Week"". Also some of it is shot in dark ocean waters and it is really hard to see what is happening. Halle Berry is certainly beautiful, but she is miscast as an expert of sharks and never believable in her acting. [img]http://content9.flixster.com/rtmovie/88/34/88347_gal.jpg[/img]",-1

Heigl's character is meant to be totally green which adds to the suspense and gives it a quirky feel. The plot holds together well and the two leads have good chemistry. There were a few laughs along the way. What's not to like?",0
3.5,It's entertaining. Not truly predictable. Somewhat funny at moments. And katherine heigle sorry if I misspelled that does a great job and so does the guy that plays at the cop on the run. I just got done watching it I enjoyed it.,0
0.5,"This is just awful. Not just anybody can become a bounty hunter, it needs skills, able to use a fire arm. And her boss sends a novice after a presumed dangerous bounty? Plus, Bounty Hunters have expense accounts for things like getting information and gas, etc. Did any of the film makers see ""The Fall Guy""? Plus what is with bad movies calling major cities with millions of people as small towns? ""Arizona Werewolf"" did with Flagstaff and this movie is going it with Trenton New Jersey. She said it's the burbs. But she keeps running into people even when not in the burbs. The story is generic and you know the direction is going. Which is no sin on its own, but the characters are so annoying and unlikable the journey isn't worth it. Nothing is unique or likable. This is one for the one that is a total waste of your money.",-1
4.0,4 stars for Katherine Heigl. The movie is fun. She's absolutely fantastic.,1
2.5,"Suitably divided interests towards the adaptation between readers and those more critically intrigued, with the drawn latter's exclusion of the source material's series from their reading list, only to sensibly find one slight of faithfulness in showcasing the carriage roots that withered by insipid and undecisive factors by both poor tastes and dullish efforts, with tiny exception of being bit humorous. (C)",-1
0.5,"This is the single worst movie I think I've ever seen and I thoroughly enjoy Katherine Heigl. I hate to put it this way, but, when you're good at something -- stick with it. She can't do the accent and really should continue in movies like ""The Ugly Truth"".",-1
5.0,"Loved the books, love the movie. The 1st book, on which this was based, was the least fun, but this was fantastic. Loved it.",1
5.0,This movie is unfairly scored on Rotten Tomatoes. It is funny with an all star cast and even gets better with repeated viewings. Debbie Reynolds is absolutely hilarious.,1
3.0,"Good watch, probably won't watch again, and can't whole-heartedly recommend. This is like a New Jersey version of ""Bounty Hunter"" with a lower production value and a less believable bounty hunter, which is part of the joke. The story is pretty dark and lacks any uplifting sense of charm, but the story structure is pretty good and there is plenty of character growth. There is some humor and decent action, but there just isn't much to return to when it comes down to it and there are much better movies to watch, ""Domino"" for instance.",0
0.5,Only redeeming quality of this movie is KH nearly and implied nudity.,-1

0.5,Heigl is fantastic... when she finds the right material. This is a reminder that she is terrible at finding the right material.,-1
1.5,"Hot dang this movie is a train wreck. I think the main character was supposed to be quirky in a clumsy, hot-mess kind of way but Heigl really can't pull that off. She still comes off kind of uptight. Her accent is also kind of inconsistent. At the start of the movie Heigl's character Stephanie is mad at the male lead whose name I forget because he took her virginity and didn't call her back, yet as soon as he starts flirting with her she immediately caves. He doesn't even flirt with her or charm her or anything he just comments on her body and she's all over him. Regardless, the plot is pretty unimportant. This is not an action movie its a romcom. Most of the scenes are centered around the sexual tension that the two leads are supposed to have, but don't. Even when Heigl is naked and handcuffed. Which reminds me, the lead guy is kind of a jerk. Not just for lying to her, taking her virginity, never calling her, and then making fun of her for being upset about it, but also for breaking in when she's in the shower and then stealing her towel so he can see her naked, which is very violating. By the end of the movie their relationship doesn't seem to develop at all and they have the same dynamic as before. As for the original conflict, we're never given a resolution. He's never made to apologize or explain why he didn't call. I think adding this in would have allowed the two characters to have a more emotional scene where Steph admits that she was hurt and we see them being authentic with one another and building their relationship. Instead, Steph continues to deny being affected and the guy continues to get away with his actions. And after over an hour of watching the actors painfully try to feign attraction for one another we don't even get an on-screen kiss. What kind of romcom skimps you on the kiss??? Unless you're looking for material to add to a presentation about why Katherine Heigl sucks there's no reason to watch this.",-1
0.5,Well this is a poor film basically. It's nowhere near the bounty hunter an that was a bad film too. They built this movie up to be a more stylish role for Katherine but it just is worse than normal for her.,-1

1.0,I loved the book but the movie version didn't stay true to the essence of the book. The producers should have made a better adaptation to better suit the screen and viewing audience. With that said that wasn't even the biggest problem. The problem really laid with the actors. Katherine Heigl was the wrong person for this movie and she was absent throughout the entire movie she wasn't even trying to act and it was a pitiful performance and that's being nice. Who's bright idea was it to choose her for this role?? None of the actors had chemistry and it was very awkward to watch. I bet the producers of this film paid her a lot and later were wondering if they could get a refund for such a dismal cringe worthy performance! I'm still not giving up on the Stephanie Plum novel and adaptation to screen. Listen get a better actress and re-do it because Katherine Heigl murdered this movie and it's ratings!,-1

2.0,"This should have been a TV series... not a movie. There is no way the level of character development, funny one liners, chemistry and the budding love triangle could be covered in a movie.

I downloaded it by accident, I was actually trying to get two for the money with Al Pacino, which is an awesome movie. I just wonder how much she got paid for this, and did she expect it to suck so badly, did she even care? So boring, and unfunny. It's not even that sexy of a movie. Total crap.",-1

5.0,loved it and read 14 of the books. It was a good effort very harshly critiqued. thought plum and morelli were great,1

2.0,"If there is a movie version of a book we read in the book club, we watch it if we can. Since one of the girls owned it, we gave it a ago. I had my hopes up and they were kinda sorta slashed to the ground and then stepped on. Pretty much the only funny parts were in the trailer. The only thing they were missing was the shower bit. THAT SCENE WAS HIIIIIIIIIIILARIOUS! HAHAHA I love Ranger. I was unsure of the actor they picked at first, but after a while I realized he was drool-worthy and perfect. The woman cast as the granny was awesome too. hehehe. The rest of the cast....meh. Especially the girl playing Stephanie Plum (I normally like her, but not in this). She could NOT maintain her New Jersey accent at all. It was super annoying. Either have an accent OR don't. Please don't annoy me with slipping back and forth....it sounds SO forced. Like, ""oh yeah...I was suppose to have an accent"" and then over do it. Bleh. It made my eye twitch.... I must pat the creators on the back, because they stuck well with the book. It followed pretty much to the T, a few edits to some scenes. A few added, a few taken away. Nothing major to complain about. It was annoying that they DID skip the backstory bit of Stephanie and the ass-I mean Joe. She mentioned they had a history, but if you hadn't read the book then you wouldn't know how deeeeeeeply and baaaaaadly Stephanie wanted to catch him. It seemed lacking and my pre-knowledge helped it along, which would not help others along. They also ""cleaned"" up the scene with Rameriz and Stephanie. I can't explain more without explaining...but it took the fear factor away from him. He's suppose to be a baddie that is scaring the crap out of Stephanie. Honestly, he scared me...but in the movie I completely forgot about him until he made a phone call and then I forgot about him again. Sighs. That took a layer away from a simple story. I will be honest...after the hour mark the gang and I lost interest and were talking a LOT. I missed the ""climax"" of the story, because I was talking DBZ with another member. I look back and go, ""Hey guys...we missed the shooting."" hahaha THAT IS SAD. OK....so...yeah. It was a let down. The book was better in my opinion and that is saying a lot (I was meh about the book). There were a few hilarious scenes and Ranger was a hottie. That is about it. After an hour it was hard to focus not only for me, but for the whole gang. I tried, but my attention and mind kept drifting. xI I recommend this to fans of the Stephanie Plum series, but it was not really for me. Bummer. I wanted to like this. Out of five stars, I stamp this with....2 stars. Ranger and the granny each got a star. haha Favorite Character(s): Granny, Ranger, the Dad (he made me laugh), and Lulu (the one nice prostitute. FUNNY AS HELL) Not-so Favorite Character(s): Joe (I did not like the character or the actor) & Ramerize (not scary...do not care) Re-watch?: No",-1
1.0,"Sooooooo boring. I already had zero interest in Heigl as an actress, but this one really solidified it. Her AND the script are stiff as hell. The comedy is dull, the romance is odd and the supporting players are desperate. The best this movie gets is... ALMOST seeing a boob.",-1
2.0,"She's looking for a few not-so-good men. St√©phanie Plum a grandement besoin d'argent. Et pour en avoir rapidement, elle choisit de travailler pour son cousin et d'amener √† la police les personnes qui ne se sont pas pr√©sent√©es √† la police malgr√© une injonction. Elle est tr√®s motiv√©e, mais n'a absolument aucune exp√©rience et aucune habilit√© pour lui permettre de mener ses missions √† bien. Qu'√† cela ne tienne, elle d√©cide en plus de s'occuper du suspect le plus recherch√© de la ville : Joe Morelli. C'est un ancien flic de la brigade des murs qui est recherch√© pour meurtre. Son arrestation lui apportera une tr√®s grosse somme d'argent, mais aussi une satisfaction personnelle, Joe ayant largu√© St√©phanie apr√®s avoir couch√© avec elle quand ils √©taient √† l'√©cole.

Cette com√©die est une adaptation d'un livre de Janet Evanovich, qui a √©crit toute une s√©rie d'ouvrages avec son h√©ro√Øne St√©phanie Plum. Personnellement, je ne connais pas ces livres et ne peux donc comparer le r√©sultat √† l'√©cran. Par contre j'avoue que j'ai trouv√© cette St√©phanie compl√®tement √©cervel√©e et sa d√©cision de devenir chasseur de prime totalement stupide. Elle n'a pas conscience du danger et n'est donc pas courageuse, par contre elle est pers√©v√©rante. Ce c√¥t√© fofolle plut√¥t √† l'ouest est bien rendu par Katherine Heigl. Mais son enqu√™te est prise trop au s√©rieux pour qu'on rentre dans le d√©lire de l'innocente inexp√©riment√©e qui a de la chance. C'est peu cr√©dible, et on se demande comment elle a pu rester vivante au vu des affaires tordues dans lesquelles elle va mettre son nez. Rajoutons par-dessus cela le flirt hyper pr√©visible entre elle et Joe, √ßa donne un film tout juste passable, mais certes pas m√©morable.",-1
3.5,"Entertaining, a great cast of characters.",0
5.0,I love this movie and I really like Kathrine Heigl as well.,1
2.0,"I wasn't expecting much from this film, and I was right. The film kind of reminded me of movies like ""The Bounty Hunter,"" ""Catch Me If You Can,"" ""Domino,"" and ""Midnight Run."" Those films were better than this one. This one needed a rewrite. They have a good idea for a film, but didn't execute it correctly. The tone of the film is off. Another big problem is that some cast members seem like they were miscast. Katherine Heigl is definitely miscast here. She has no on screen chemistry with Jason O'Mara. I think Reese Witherspoon would have done a better job in that role. I also think O'Mara was miscast. I think Bradley Cooper would have done a better job in that role. On a positive, there is some great supporting work here from Daniel Sunjata, John Leguizamo, Debbie Reynolds, and Fisher Stevens.",-1

5.0,Don't care what the critics say - this film is a girl home alone guilty pleasure,1
3.5,"As a fan of the book series, my opinion of the film might be slightly biased. While I agree that there was a bit of miscasting involved (Debbie Reynolds as Grandma Mazur ...?), Katherine Heigl practically IS Stephanie Plum, giving a believable performance as the spunky, bumbling bounty hunter and Sherri Shepard is the perfect Lula. While there are some unnecessary changes made from the novel, ""One for the Money"" is a more than passable adaptation of the first Stephanie Plum mystery.",0
1.5,"Katherine Heigl looks great, she has a sassy edge and her performance is solid but even her comedic talent can't compensate for One For The Money's lack of laughs and action thrills. Down on her luck Stephanie Plum (Heigl) takes a job for her sleazy cousin in his bail bond business, only to realise her target is her ex. If Plum can catch him and take him in she'll get her hands on a sweet amount of money, and feel even better knowing she's put away her ex. Decent premise but bad execution, it took a good 30 minutes till I laughed, even though it was more of an awkward chuckle. The only word to describe this film is dry, sucked free of comedy. Daniel Sunjata lacks charisma and is just there to make Heigl's character look less qualified for the job. Sherri Sheperd is as funny as ever but only appears for a few minutes, the supporting cast are a mixed bag, never living up to the shine of the lead star. One For The Money is one of those films that you have to trudge through, you don't really enjoy it yet can't turn it off as you hope it will improve as the minutes pass by, but sadly it stays on auto-pilot.",-1

3.5,Katherine Heigl effectively saves this film.,0
2.5,"A fun mix of crime, thriller and comedy based in the book with the same title by Janet Evanovich. It follows the endeavours of Stephanie Plum, an unemployed and recently divorced young lady forced to take a job as a bounty hunter at her cousin's Vinnie bail bond business. Her first assignment is to retrieve Joe Morelli to justice. He is a cop accused of murder that used to be Stephanie's old flame. When Stephanie starts to investigate the whereabouts of Joe she starts to unravel a web of dirty business that will put her life in danger. After several killings, chases and even a bomb Stephanie starts to learn the ropes of this difficult trade. Never read one of the Stephanie Plum books but I can see what makes them attractive: a pretty determined divorcee with a tough job but making no excuses for it follows to the end. Unfortunately those traits are what make it really hard to believe what is happening in the screen. No inexperienced woman could do that job successfully, even less an ex-Macy's lingerie manager with no gun. If you don't mind the unlikeness of the story you can probably appreciate the small array of funny and warm characters, Lulla, Ranger, cousin Vinnie, Grandma, Bernie Kuntz... the action scenes, the humour of the dialogues. In the low notes the mafia story is a little blurred, everything happens very quickly and it isn't properly explained. It is as much enjoyable as it is forgettable, probably I will end up reading the book it sounds as it could be good fun.",-1

0.5,"Watching Katherine Heigl in One for the Money is painful, because its like watching someone's career die right before your eyes. She's a dedicated actress, even dedicated to the stupidest of roles. Unfortunately of all her films this has the stupidest of roles in it because One for the Money fails to choose between being a romantic comedy and a crime thriller, without succeeding in either area and failing at being a hybrid of both due to a script which is as funny as Schindler's List and directional work from Julie Anne Robinson who would have better luck demolishing the walls of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp with a toothpick than she would have directing a film. Unfortunately, she traps Katherine Heigl in a prison of her own in One for the Money and knocks her down to a point where she will have a limited time to prove herself as an actress again before she becomes so typecast in terrible movies that she will have to begin appearing nude to maintain commercial success as an actress. There is a brief moment in One for the Money where we see foreshadowing of that with Katherine Heigl appearing nude in the shower although covering herself up, and it is damned hot, but considering its the single memorable scene in this lackluster attempt to ruin Katherine Heigl's career which almost succeeds in that section due to the requirements of no talent for the cast and crew involved next to everything else being completely messed up.",-1

Anyway the storyline was umm...easy to follow, in other words very low budget. I wouldn't watch it again by choice. Would I recommend it? Nope. Unrecommended",-1

From the first moment, I never bought this depiction of the novice bounty hunter. Heigl just seems overmatched when playing an action star (see my review of Killers). The story just seems to take illogical turns and the characters are very inconsistent. I did like the rapport between Heigl and her bounty, played by television star O'Mara. Their relationship was a little too cute for me considering the unique situation they were in. This film ended up playing out like a slightly worse version of the Aniston/Butler movie, The Bounty Hunter, with the roles reversed, of course.",-1

She picks out the file who have the biggest bounty who conveniently happens to be one of her ex's and assumes that he'll come along quietly and that the job is a cinch.

3.0,"Why do best-selling mystery series featuring female detectives have such a hard time on the big screen? Even though Kathleen Turner was still close to the peak of her Kathleen Turner-ness 20 years ago, her playing Sara Paretsky√¢(TM)s Chicago-based heroine in √¢V.I. Warshawsky√¢(TM)√¢(TM) was a dud. Now joining Turner in distaff detective dud-dom is Katherine Heigl, playing Janet Evanovich√¢(TM)s decidedly non-macho New Jersey-based bounty hunter, Stephanie Plum. √¢One for the Money,√¢(TM)√¢(TM) based on the first novel in the series, isn√¢(TM)t terrible. Terrible might have been more interesting. Like Heigl, the director, Julie Anne Robinson, is a veteran of √¢Grey√¢(TM)s Anatomy,√¢(TM)√¢(TM) and the movie has the by-the-numbers efficiency of a decent TV series, and about as much flavor. Having been laid off six months earlier as the manager of a Macy√¢(TM)s lingerie department, Stephanie√¢(TM)s so desperate for a job she goes to work for her cousin, a bail bondsman. She can earn herself $50,000 by bringing in a cop charged with murder (Jason O√¢(TM)Mara) who√¢(TM)s skipped bail. Even better, a decade later she√¢(TM)s still smarting over his having dumped her after a one-night stand in high school. So Stephanie is definitely on the case. This eventually leads to encounters with a couple of comedy-relief hookers, several other murders, and a heroin ring. The biggest problem √¢One for the Money√¢(TM)√¢(TM) faces is trying to have it both ways: gritty-ethnic inner city vs. girly-girly comic. √¢One-hundred twenty-five pounds of angry female can do a lot of damage,√¢(TM)√¢(TM) Stephanie boasts after tackling a bad guy - √¢130, tops√¢(TM)√¢(TM) (which would be a lot funnier if Heigl had any reason to joke about her weight).

Al Pacino's performance is just...bizarre, there is no other way to say it.

The other characters aren't much better. There's just nothing in this movie that's redeeming. 1 or 2 jokes made me chuckle but that's it. If I'm being honest, I think Jack and Jill is the reason why many people hate Adam Sandler movies. Not everyone, but many people in my opinion. This movie sucks, literally go watch any other Adam Sandler instead.",-1

I always love to dress like Jill and I tend to act like her too (obviously not the gross parts) and I even showed this movie to my friends and we always reference it! I really love this movie and everyone I know who has seen it always references it! Especially Poopsie, ""Where were you?!,"" the bathroom scene with the guy fixing Jill's boobs, and Felipe's classic ""I'm kidding! I'm kidding!""

0.5,"ETHAN YUCHEN LOU - JACK AND JILL Want to know who the 2012 raspberry awards went to? Jack and Jill is the answer! Although this film is ONLY about one and a half hours long, which makes it shorter than the majority of movies that we see nowadays, the pain you get from watching it is just unbelievable. Unclear narrative arcs, bad characterization, jokes that sound ridiculous and offensive are only the few factors that made the film grasp the worst Oscars (worst actor and actress, worst picture, worst screenplay etc.) tight. Jack and Jill is a movie set in the thanksgiving period. The movie starts by introducing Jack, who works at an advertising company. He encounters a problem, where his main customer, Dunkin donuts, claims that they would only continue the business with his company if he can get the worldwide famous actor, Al Pacino, to do the Advertising of their product. However, during this time period, Jill, an annoying, obnoxious pest come home for thanksgiving. After then, a whole set of cringe and disturbing drama unravels. With that, I will let your imagination take over. The awful characterization of the film is probably the first thing that any viewer would notice. In Jack and Jill, Adam Sandler plays both Jack and Jill. Right in the beginning of the film, viewers would quickly notice this, as they look alike, and it is clear that the character Jill was just Jack with tons of makeup. Jill also speaks in a sharp and unnatural voice, which basically ruins the entire film already by just listening to them talking. I don't want to even say anything about the acting, since its just crappy. Jack uses the same expression: a bored and annoyed look throughout the movie. In fact, both Jill and Jack seemed like that they were looking forward to lunch. They almost know that it will be a bad movie, so why bother trying in the first place? I'll tell you why the film ended up ""winning"" the worst picture and screenplay. As viewers we may wonder, if Adam Sandler plays both of the characters, how does the director film both of them at once in one frame? The answer is simple. The camera doesn't move and the scene is shot twice, one with Jack and one with Jill. Later, they are combined together to make one scene. This takes a lot of work as the scenes get bigger and more people start coming in. So, what did the director do? Well, the majority of shots contain just one of Jack or Jill. So, what you are expected to see is the constant change of camera angle focused on either Jack or Jill for about the entire movie. In other words, the filmmaking is dull, cheap and boring. Besides all the reasons above, I do have one more point to make before I get on to the most ridiculous bit. The film lacks a stable goal, or McGuffin. Some possible McGuffins I can think of (after a desperate search of my brain) was getting Jill out of the house, having Al Pacino do the advertisement and having Al Pacino in love with Jill. These McGuffins switch every 10 minutes or so, so by the end of the film, you won't even realize that it ended, nor you would capture what the film wanted to say. The plot of this film was just confusing and dumb. The absolute WORST part of the film is definitely the horrible and ridiculous jokes that the film tries to make. Although this film is a comedy, having these jokes are just offensive, rude and does not make you laugh. Instead, you wonder why you're here watching this. At the start of the film, Jill criticizes Otto, who is a homeless man, for making the chair dirty and ruining the atmosphere. The most offensive part is when Jill whispers LOUDLY and says, ""he's homeless, right? He seems clean but you should put those toilet seats underneath him to make sure that he doesn't ruin the chair."" Incredible, right? Incredibly offensive, rude and a horrible attempt of a joke. What would you think if you were Otto? Well, this is another plot hole in the film. Why would a homeless man be included in a thanksgiving banquet? Perhaps the family was feeling nice‚Ä¶ but there isn't a clear intro of how he gets to his seat, which makes it confusing for viewers to understand. So, if you were deciding whether to watch this film or not, and came to the website for inspiration, I suggest you close that tab now, and make sure you erase that history so no one will know that you somehow even got tempted to watch it. If you just came to the website due to boredom, then at least I've saved an hour and a half of your life.",-1
0.5,"I like comedy when it is funny. I have to admit though, apart from Punch Drunk Love, Reign Over Me, Spanglish, The Wedding Singer, 50 First Dates and Happy Gilmore I have never liked Adam Sandler. I often find his acting style irritating, his characters unlikeable and apart from five or six exceptions his films poorly written with not much point to them. As much as I didn't think much of Little Nicky, You Don't Mess With the Zohan, Funny People and I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry(generally Anger Management, The Longest Yard, Click and The Waterboy I had mixed feelings on) neither of them are as painful to watch as this one. The trailer was enough to make me wish the ground had swallowed me up, and the film managed to be every bit as bad. So why did I see Jack and Jill in the first place if I didn't like Sandler? One reason really. Al Pacino. I consider this man a great actor, and this is not just The Godfather, Dog Day Afternoon, Scent of a Woman and Carlito's Way as I consider his performance in Godfather Part II one of the all-time great male performances. When I saw the movie on Tinyurl, having an inkling it would be bad but Pacino would be at least decent, in my opinion this is as awful as I was hearing. This is not just Adam Sandler's worst film, but also one of the worst of the year and one of the worst I've seen recently. Jack and Jill is a cheap-looking movie, with not much attention to slick editing or continuity and the lighting also manages to be dull. Of Sandler's movies, Jack and Jill is perhaps the worst-directed, because the director throughout seemed to be rushing through it. The soundtrack at best is forgettable, and doesn't seem dynamic with what's going on on screen. The acting is awful. Adam Sandler is a big part of the film's problem. None of his characters are likable, instead they are very annoying and Sandler's performance is samey and irritating throughout. Not only that, Jill is introduced too quickly with a severe lack of build-ups, and Sandler as a woman in all honesty is not pretty, sorry I had to say. I was hoping that Al Pacino would elevate just a little bit, as he was the only redeeming quality of Gigli, another example of a bad film. Alas, he spends the entire movie looking bored, almost as if what am I doing here, and the performance reads very much of him playing himself. The cameos don't engage either, they are not funny, in fact pretty much nobody seems to have a sense of comic timing, and just come and go. Nicky Swardson fares best, surprising seeing as I don't regard him very highly either. Worse are the script, characters and story. In regards to the script and the humour, Jack and Jill fails utterly. The dialogue is atrocious, very immature and hackneyed, while the physical and visual humour just left a bad taste in the mouth. I get that it was meant to be funny and not to be exactly subtle, but the poop jokes for example got really embarrassing and left me more disgusted than amused. Story-wise, Jack and Jill lacks any kind of structure, it all feels very broken and rushed. As for the characters, they are either annoying, shallow or both, I finished the film not only not caring for them but also forgetting them. All in all, Sandler's worst movie and one of the worst(I think only Bucky Larson: Born to be a Star, a movie I saw out of curiosity with little else to do, was worse) of a very hit-and-miss year. 0/10 Bethany Cox",-1
3.0,Oh my goodness. Another Adam film that always makes me laugh. I enjoyed it for the most part. My reason for 3 stars is simply because the Al Pacino and Jill romance got a bit receptive and tiring. I had a few good laughs at this one - the child of Adam (the little boy) made me cackle!

It's also a good thing that this movie is Rated PG, but it's a shame that it's still underrated after 10 years. There's really nothing awful about ""Jack & Jill"" like many people keep saying because at least it wouldn't negatively portray autistic people the way ""The Waterboy"" did, especially since Adam Sandler reportedly said he didn't like ""The Waterboy"" because of that reason. If there's ever a sequel for ""Jack & Jill"", I'm paying good money to watch it.",1

This was not a gem of a story, but it still had its moments. Duration/Tempo: (3.5/5) At 1 hour and 31 minutes, it's a very short film that felt short to average. Trimming the film down to 90 minutes was a good call. Cast & Crew: (4/5) The film revolved around Adam Sandler's dual characters, and his portrayals of both were excellent.

1.0,"I want to make this as clear as possible: when I was a teen, I enjoyed watching the dumb comedies by Adam Sandler and Happy Madison. However, as I got older, my admiration of those movies faded, especially after watching arguably his worst project yet, Jack and Jill. The premise is about Jack (Adam Sandler) whose long-lost twin sister, Jill (also Sandler), arrives at his house and stays from Thanksgiving to Hanukkah. Other goofy antics involve a Mexican illegal immigrant Felipe (Eugenio Derbez) whom Jill falls in love with, a sponsorship from Dunkin' Donuts, a trip to a cruise ship, and a stalking Al Pacino. While not my least favorite movie, it was still insufferable to sit through, even with Sandler's gratingly tired bad taste routine and his annoying female voice. However, as the movie continued, his falsetto became infectious and made me feel the possible promise for a voice over role for the former SNL comedian. The worst scenes involve Al Pacino, one of the greatest and most inspiring actors of all time, reduced to a pervert and spokesman for a mediocre donut chain. Of all the ludicrous moments in Jack and Jill, the ultimate all time low came from the scene where Pacino performs ""Richard III'' on Broadway and his cell phone rings during the show. Being a guy who has taken acting classes, I felt ashamed seeing the Oscar-winning actor put it in his costume, taking that phone call in the middle of his performance, and prematurely shooting daggers at the audience, rather than letting the anger affect his performance like any actor with a 50-year resume in his belt. I swear it took at least an hour before I calmed myself down, suspended my disbelief, and carried on watching one of Sandler's weakest films. (1 David Spade in Drag out of 5)",-1

Within twenty minutes I was back on drugs. This is undoubtably the movie equivalent of having your fingernails pulled out by a rusty fork, but nowhere near as pleasant or entertaining. After seeing this disgrace, I am wholly convinced Sandler hasn't been anywhere near a woman he hasn't paid as his depiction of one resembled a character from a pantomime showcased at a working men's club but on a meagre equivalent of the budget. Racism and fart joke's a ‚Äòplenty sandwiched between Sandler and Pacino trying to flog coca cola and donuts, the sinister stink of capitalism has never been so evident. Jack and Jill is a scam so embarrassing it wouldn't even be considered between ed, edd and eddy, and I carried that shame for days after viewing. This film solidified the fact there is no higher entity as one would not be so cruel to allow this abomination into the world. It makes click look like a Sandro Botticelli painting -200",-1
0.5,It's so hard to watch even 15 minutes of this movie!!! One of the worst Adam Sandler's movies.,-1
5.0,"Jack and Jill is an absolute MUST see! The heart-racing conflict between Jack and his twin sister Jill keeps the entire audience on their feet. As a hard-core Adam Sandler fan, I have watched this movie at least 26 times. It takes an intense adventure between two twins with a heart-breaking past and brings them together harmoniously and seamlessly in the most entertaining way. There has yet to be another movie as well made, directed, and cast like this one. Sandler playing bother leads? A man AND a woman? Genius! How woke",1

0.5,"I remember when this movie first came out; I was 12 years old and me and my family used to love Adam Sandler because he had a few good movies so we decided to buy the dvd. I remember how excited we where to watch it but when we started watching it we couldn‚Äôt get past the first 25 minutes because of how unfunny and garbage this movie was. A few weeks later me and my brother tried watching the whole movie because we only watched the first 25 minutes, on our second attempt we failed again and just couldn‚Äôt bear the horridness so we ended up destroying the CD and melting it. I honestly can‚Äôt explain to you how bad this movie is, till this day I am in shock and discussed",-1

If you want to be known for anything other than who you fuck than you need to actually have at least a modicum of talent. Something Minks show's time and time again she lacks. Thank god for botox, nose jobs, and breast implants, right minks?",-1

2.0,"? If stars came in fourths, it would be a 1.75, mainly because it's only as good as 75% of the movies that I would normally rate a 2 in terms of horror. This is like a senseless hodgepodge of other movie plots and typical horror, takes mental health too lightly as well as misuses what potentially could have been a much better plot point, and made me get up for popcorn... TWICE. I wonder if the college whose building was on the movie poster sued the makers AFTER they saw the film... Not unwatchable, but not worth a trip to even the dollar theater.",-1

4.0,"Okay I need to start off by saying I'm not giving this movie a four star because I think it's a four star movie, I think it's more of a three, but I gave it a four because the reviews for this film are so low it makes me cringe. This is honestly one of my favourite movies. The acting is great and the story line is actually pretty good, there is very predictable scenes in this movie but I don't understand why someone would give this movie a one, like come on, there's movies out there that get an 80% on here and they straight up sucked. Moral of my comment is if you haven't seen this movie by now, take my word for it, it's not awful, it's pretty decent. Not a work of art, the ending is definitely predictable but again like I said, it's good, give it a try.",1

1.0,yeah was a good movie an all. but extremely more than f*cked up and made me absolutely hate the movie for the scene where rebecca locks and cooks the kitten in a dryer. could've simply gotten her to bring the cat to a shelter or let it go. they did not have to go to that extent. f*cked up.,-1
1.0,"For a movie that's only 90 minutes, it's still really slow. There's not a lot going on. Obsessive roommate is a psycho and does psycho-stalker things. It failed to keep my interest.",-1
1.0,"This is a wannabe thriller or suspense movie that doesn't deliver. The ending is pretty much spoiled for you in the first 30min so you spend 1h knowing what is going to happen and the movie doesn't really build up effectively till it gets there so the climax doesn't work properly. The directors work is decent though acting is mostly mediocre. The best actor was Cam Gigandet that makes a clear effort to do his job right even with bad lines and a bad story to be a part of. It kind of reminds me of ""Single White Female"".",-1

1.0,Terrible horrible cringe boring fest of a movie. The only reason I wanted to see this movie is because the girl from Phil of the future was in this and she was barely in it.

0.5,"""The Roommate"" is one of those movies that is just bad in every regard. This sort of stalker thriller that has been many times but without any real thrills. The movie's story is actually super boring and has no complexity. It's both generic and boring, which makes it nearly unwatchable. Also, the acting and writing are very bad and it is not convincing at all. In fact, a lot of this movie actually made me unintentionally laugh. In that, I think you could say this movie is so hilariously awful, its so bad its fun at times. However, it's not enough to sit through the 90 minutes the movie subjected me to. There are few movies that I hate this much in existence, and this mess of a thriller has joined them. I can't think of a single redeeming quality in it and think its a total waste of time.",-1
5.0,This was a great movie! I'm sort of bummed that I'm seeing a negative review! I just watched on Netflix and was thrilled! The ending was pretty great!,1

3.5,"The movie was generally decent, but it ended abruptly which was disappointing. Though I skipped some bloody scenes, I love Leighton Meester's acting skills, the opposite attitude of her when she is around Minka and when she is spying her love competitor (that is how Rebecca viewed it).",0

Wow it was really that bad. I don't think I can find a single redeemable quality in this film, so if you're wondering, ""What about this was so bad?"" It's everything. Whatever you're thinking, yup that's a reason why. But hey, who knows, maybe that's a reason to watch it? Because it's so bad? I don't know.",-1

Rebecca was getting to annoying and I couldn't wait for somebody to kill her already. I mean who acts so weird like her. That's just insane, I agree with the others it was a waste of time in a way.

I first thought it was an ok/good horror or psyco movie but the end blow it all for me, it was cinda big with fight and all but after just before the credits I just thought: Eh what? Who would react like that?No police? I actually think Minka kelly did her part very bad in the film, I feelt more for Rebecca and her family than the actual lead role Sara. So in the end I think this is more a psyco movie than horror (but deadreact and white eyes always gets me chills) and a feeling that it could have been so much better than it is with many good ideas.",-1

1.5,"You can predict the whole film from the moment ""the roommate"" appears especially if you have watched before movies like ""Orphan"", ""The Sitter"", and ""Homecoming"" which all have similar plots. This one lacks thrills and doesn't add anything new, you can't even qualify it as OK.",-1
2.0,I enjoyed this film sort of not a scary movie just creepy C,-1

Even the stalking/mental issues are pretty down to earth, instead of full blown psycho to at least make the plot decent. Overall, a pretty bad film.",-1
2.0,"I quite liked this film, even though its quite trashy and doesn't have much of a plot.

They have that accurate as how the ""psycho manifests their ways to psychotic, personality disorder. On that I will give them a 6 out of 10 star rating.",-1

0.5,"The Apparition is yet another horror film that brings nothing new to the table. It one of those films that just bore you into tears. When frightening events start to occur in their home, a young couple, Kelly (Ashley Greene) and Ben (Sebastian Stan) discover they are being haunted by a presence that was accidentally conjured during a university parapsychology experiment. The horrifying apparition feed on their fear and torments them no matter where they to run. Their last hope Patrick (Tom Felton) who is an expert in the supernatural, but even with his help they may already be too late to save themselves from this terrifying force. Sigh, where do I begin? The Apparition is one the worst horror films I have ever having the pleasure to sit through. I never seen a horror film that is monotonous in every way. Is The Apparition scary? No, it is really isn't. In fact, I could see the jump-scares coming every minute of the film. The script of the film is really abysmal. It causes the characters to do things that a normal person will never do. It was so bad that I questioned how did the script get pass the studio. And no acting is no better. No one gives a decent performance in this film. No one not even Tom Felton which is so sad because he was good in Rise of the Planet of the Apes and The Harry Potter series. Ashley Greene on the other hand, I expect a bad performance out her because she was in the Twilight series. And no that is not saying much. And Sebastian Stan wasn't much better either so yeah. The ending yet again is just insulting. Why is it insulting? Because it is pretty much spoiled in the trailer. After seeing that ""ending,"" I never felt more insulted in my life. At the end of the day, The Apparition was so bad (and yes it really was) that I being to question why Warner Bros. want to release this drivel across the world. Besides the mediocre effects, that does not save the film from being terrible. And compare to The Apparition, The Devil Inside isn't that bad now. Plus, The Devil Inside is up there with The Exorcist, Halloween (the original), and The Nightmare on Elm Street (again the original) as one the scariest horror films of all time (yeah, not really). On almost every level, The Apparition is an utter failure. Thankfully, it did not make its budget back otherwise we would have gotten a sequel to this dreadful nonsense. Avoid The Apparition unless you like to be bore out of your mind.",-1

0.5,"There's not a shadow of doubt within me that Paramount suckered Warner Bros. into releasing this film all so that their own Paranormal Activity franchise could come off smelling like a basket of roses. The late Gene Siskel had a litmus test for films likes this: Is the film more interesting than a documentary of the cast and crew having lunch? The answer with The Apparition is not only a resounding no, but there's more frights and chills and thrills to be found in watching paint dry on a wall. When the creepiest scenes of the movie are the Paramount and Dark Castle intros, that's not a good sign.

2.5,"""The Apparition"" tales the story of a young couple playing house only to find out the terrors hidden in the home as well as their relationship. The film is directed by Todd Lincoln and stars Ashley Greene, Sebastian Stan and Tom Felton. The film actually focuses on the exploration of urban legend and the paranormal as well accenting the freshness of a life anew with relationship and promise. Kelly and Ben are a young couple starting life together just as horrors set upon them. Ben is a collegiate who explores the realms of paranormal experimentation only to have to deal with the nightmare ramifications that ensue. Soon Ben and Kelly battle ghastly forces from beyond the realm of the dead as an entity invades their lives and halts the beginnings of their happy home. For me the film has some serious potential for scares but unfortunately it is as if the director pulled back on most of the scary moments instead of going for broke. Moments when the scenes begin to build to thrilling climaxes the actual luster fades and we are almost pre-warned or backed down from a true terrifying moment. With that said there are some scary moments that make you jump but there could have been so many more. The surreal and ominous atmosphere that is created in this more subdued supernatural horror film is intense and foreboding which give to the story's dark nature. The casual and serious approach to the story casts an almost monotone of mournfulness even when the scene doesn't call for such emotion which sometimes creates a somewhat sleeper moment to the film. The story around the paranormal entity however is intense, dark and sinister which hold most of this movie tightly together and give us our actual active scary moments. ""The Apparition"" didn't completely leave me disappointed but it did slightly frustrate me because I found myself forcing complete interest in the movie as it went along and never felt quite convinced it was a horror movie. It is a film that one could take or leave and never be the lesser for doing so.",-1

There weren't any room for any scares or compels to get a share when they were in the trailer. It's just a mediocre film I guess with a few little thrills and a elimination with a power to usually lower down a film's level. (C+) (Full review coming soon)",0
0.5,"There's an art to making a horror movie with limited resources, one that involves suggesting danger rather than showing it and building tension out of virtually nothing happening. But sometimes suggestions just hang in the air pointing nowhere and virtually nothing happening feels like just that. Just because there's an art to something doesn't make everyone who attempts it is an artist. The Apparition, the first feature by writer-director Todd Lincoln, features a small cast and takes place largely in an empty suburban home, one of the few occupied houses in a California neighborhood filled with unsold lots. It's an eerie premise, but this director does not have any of the talent to pull it off.",-1
2.5,"It's exactly what you think it will be. No better or worse than any other straight to dvd horror movie. Felt like watching something creepy with a few scares and this delivers. I think this movie has been unfairly panned. While it's not a masterpiece, it does make sense and, honestly, do you usually rent an unheard of horror movie for the great acting? As it happens, cast is fine. Ashley Green is a decent actress, got to admit, she and the boyfriend are both so pretty it does feel a bit like an advert at first, but again, that's typical in this genre. Tom Felton is pretty good as well. End credits are very nice to look at also. I certainly wouldn't advise anyone to run out and purchase this, but if it happened to be on TV, I don't think it's a total waste of an hour and a bit.

If you want me to pick what was the worst thing in the movie, I would say the 'always on suspense never climaxes' background score.

3.0,"A bit better than most standard horror movie. Not too bad. In the 70s, a few para physics tried an experiment to contact their dead colleague. In the 1980s, 3 university students (Sebastian Stan, Tom Felton and Julianna Guill) did a parapsychology experiment of the same to which they incidentally open up a door portal for a kind of ghost to enter the world. Resulting the death of Julianna as she is capture and disappear into a wall. Years passed, Sebastian and his girlfriend Ashley Greene move into a new house. First night there the newly bought cactus withered and the locked door opened when they were asleep. Sebastian install CCTV and changed the locks. Their neighbor's pet dog enter their kitchen, saw something and die immediately. Their house flooring grow mold suddenly. Tom emailed Sebastian about the experiment update but he ignore. Tom did a second experiment to trap the entities in his apparition chamber. But it failed and the entity is loose into the world. After shower Ashley saw the hangars twisted and scratches on the wall. She bought a new dog to compensate her neighbor. Ashley saw the experiment video in Sebastian hard disk and confront him. She is angry he didn't tell her such a thing happened and he knew what's going on all along. They stay in a motel for the night. Sebastian awaken and find himself stuck to the ceiling, looking at his sleeping body. Ashley is covered by the blanket and nearly vacuum packed to death. He manage to get down back to his body and rip the blanket saving her. Tom finally contact Sebastian and told them his findings. It is a supernatural source which is more powerful than spirits and ghost as its not of human world. Their experiment open a portal and then unlock the door for them to come in. The portal is getting bigger. It feeds on them and want to get into their world. The trio go back to the house and do another experiment in reverse hoping to close the portal. 2 days passed after it, all is peaceful. Tom was drinking and sitting down. The door behind him open and suck him in. Sebastian and Ashley go to hiding in Tom's chamber but it cannot block the presence. Sebastian also end up dead rather quickly after entering the chamber. Ashley run out but the car is overturn and no chance to survive. She go to a camping tent in the mall and wait for death. Many hands surrounded her and she is dead..",0

This movie could have been really good have it provide some decent scares but there's nothing there. Kept waiting for something good to happen but to no avail. The plot was lazily written and the acting was downright awful. Glad I did not have to waste my money on seeing this because it was on HBO which we had free for the weekend because I would have been mad.

3.0,"The reason I give this movie 3/5 stars bears no relation to the consensus opinion. The extreme gravity of the judgment combined with the characteristic succinctness of the genre of artistic criticism that constitutes the medium as it comes across to us viewers, seems incredibly harsh and a touch rash. In terms of originality, I doubt anybody walked into this film expecting to see Star Wars or The Matrix; and while it may not smack of novelty it certainly has its share of charms. The manner in which the plot unfolds, for instance. It may be a little rough around the edges, shifting point of view quite abruptly, but once you put the pieces together and the elements make sense The Apparition is quite an impressive film. If you're like me, in the minority, you may actually come to admire the direction and vision that went into its imperfect but still pretty good execution. The pace is slow at times, sure, but the horror factor is high. *Spoiler alert: getting trapped between wall partitions is definitely high on my list of scariest ways to die.* The setting and computer design coordinator deserves lots of credit for putting together the scene in the house when everything gets flipped upside down, and what about the creature that crawls out of the shadows looking like something from the Grudge? The budget was no problem, the sky is the limit, so you know the effects are spot on. Why Mr. Tomatohead is the score so low? What could possibly explain such a phenomenon? Some things in this world truly baffle me. This is one of them.",0

Morgan Freeman, 80 years old still starring in major motion films and Tommy Lee Jones, 71 at the time of this film, still bringing in the sharp dialogue and roguish charm he's known for. It was a fun ride watching these old actors still pony up a good show, a few laughs and an entertaining storyline. I've never been to a retirement community but to see Freeman become the boss of his - I don't know what it is that I love about this but I think it's the fact that this movie feels more realistic. I can actually see some of this happening for actors of this age. Most of all, if you're looking for a movie to pass the time with on a Saturday night, order a pizza and sit back - this is great. Is it oscar worthy? Nah. But the sense of ridiculousness about the entire situation scene-by-scene made Just Getting Started well worth watching. The critics are unnecessarily harsh here.

I would say a lousy writing and script is what leads to these great actors not performing well. The was there but sadly it was a disaster as it was to serious in that aspect and sarcastic and hard to get sometimes. The sounds where great but the complete lack of music in certain scenes did not help the movie overall. It was a rushed plot-less movie which would have done a lot better if it where a TV short, because the plot was lacking a lot of content to the base. Overall this is a flawed movie down to the core and it is very disappointing even despite having some elements as entertainment and fun handled well.

1.0,"√â verdade, o cartaz de Just Getting Started √© apenas composto pelos tr√™s atores principais, o que n√£o √© nada descabido, tendo em conta que n√£o h√° mais nada de interesse para ver. O experiente realizador e argumentista Ron Shelton volta ao grande ecr√£ depois da estreia do filme Hollywood Homicide (2003). Com uma pausa de 14 anos, o seu trabalho ficou altamente pregui√ßoso, e nem o talento √† frente da c√¢mara consegue salvar o desastre que √© o enredo desta longa-metragem. A hist√≥ria desta com√©dia com a√ß√£o centra-se em Duke Diver (Morgan Freeman), o gerente da Villa Capri, uma comunidade de aposentados em Palm Springs, onde √© idolatrado, principalmente pelas mulheres. Mas o seu estatuto √© amea√ßado quando Leo (Tommy Lee Jones) entra em jogo com segundas inten√ß√µes, chamando a aten√ß√£o do g√©nero feminino (Glenne Headly, num dos seus √∫ltimos pap√©is; Sheryl Lee Ralph; e Elizabeth Ashley), incluindo a rec√©m-chegada Suzie (Rene Russo). Incomodado com a situa√ß√£o, Duke n√£o tem apenas de se preocupar com a sua vida amorosa, pois n√£o s√≥ tem problemas do seu passado por resolver, como a corpora√ß√£o que det√©m Villa Capri n√£o concorda com os seus m√©todos de gest√£o. A premissa, al√©m de gen√©rica, √© desenvolvida sem ritmo e clareza. Com um fundo que pretende demonstrar as din√¢micas de uma comunidade de aposentados, o enredo estende-se at√© uma rivalidade de dois homens √† procura de supremacia emocional e ainda uma vingan√ßa que s√≥ dispersa ainda mais o filme. O problema n√£o √© propriamente a segmenta√ß√£o da narrativa, mas sim o facto de Shelton querer mostrar um pouco de tudo e acabar por n√£o executar nenhuma das ideias de forma consistente. A localiza√ß√£o do filme oferece cor e um ambiente de descontra√ß√£o que condiz com a qualidade relaxada que procura alcan√ßar. Este aspeto, a par com as atua√ß√µes competentes por parte de atores com m√∫ltiplas premia√ß√µes, √© tudo o que o filme oferece em termos de aproveitamento. O di√°logo √© desprovido de nuances, o que limita as personagens √†s suas caracter√≠sticas principais, nunca conseguindo gerar um conflito palp√°vel. Tudo seria mais perdo√°vel se pelo menos o filme fosse engra√ßado, j√° que em termos de a√ß√£o temos de esperar pelos √∫ltimos 20 minutos apenas para sermos desiludidos com uma montagem desastrosa. Para meu receio, nem o p√∫blico-alvo vai conseguir encontrar humor nesta hist√≥ria corriqueira. No m√°ximo, evocar√° uns breves sorrisos por simpatia e respeito ao passado destas figuras do cinema. Duke diz que est√° apenas a come√ßar, mas sinceramente mais vale ficar por a√≠. Com o clima natal√≠cio como plano de fundo, o projeto de Ron Shelton est√° longe de captar a alegria e harmonia da quadra, desperdi√ßando o talento de atores conceituados com material desprovido de perspic√°cia e subst√¢ncia c√≥mica. 2/10",-1

The jokes are creaky and unfunny; the story is past its sell by date and the direction is clumsy, bordering on amateurish? What type of blackmail was required to draw Morgan Freeman and Tommy Lee Jones to appear in this film? What kind of blackmail was required to get movie theaters to make space for this movie in the same month in which Star Wars The Last Jedi is being released? https://geeks.media/movie-review-justing-getting-started?_ga=2.92719453.1126457623.1513947710-953607229.1513947710",-1

0.5,One of the worst movies I have ever seen in the theater. One of the most unfunny comedies I have ever seen. Which was surprising when you look at the talent in the cast. I usually dont leave a theater during a film but this was one of the rare occasions. Skip this movie.,-1

0.5,do not waste your time. it was just a poorly acted drunken skit.,-1
0.5,"I actually wanted to see the show, the actors are amazing and I felt like this was going to be a movie definitely worth watching. About 10 minutes into the movie I came to the sad realization that this was going to be a very painful hour and a half of my life. The screenwriting was so bad there's not enough adjectives to begin to describe that, and I didn't know who to blame, the screenwriter or the director, after the movie I realized the same person did both jobs. I would never recommend this movie to anyone that I liked, And I'm not sure I hate anybody bad enough to encourage them to see this movie.",-1

1.5,"Freeman carries the movie. Tommy Lee Jones looks like a broken down wreck and it's not make up or acting. He walks through his part. Rene Russo once again proves she is a permanent back-up. The dialog is pretty bad. . . Bordering on sophomoric. The plot invented while the writer was showering one morning I think. No rocket science with this one. Finally, I don't know if Freeman realizes how much he resembles Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson dancing across a Shirley Temple movie stage when he does his Limbo Warm up moves. Not recommended unless you have nothing to do and the ticket price is less than $8",-1
0.5,This was a big disappointment. I love Morgan Freeman and Tommy Lee Jones in most movies but this was far from even mediocre.,-1
1.0,Trailer was the the only good part! Slow Boring & not much humor! Not even close to the way it was portrayed,-1
1.0,"Starring Morgan Freeman, Tommy Lee Jones with Rene Russo, Jane Seymour, Elizabeth Ashley and an appearance by Johnny Mathis with a script by and directed by Ron Shelton of ""Bull Durham"", ""Tin Cup"" and ""White Men Can't Jump"" how can a movie be this bad? The fact that it wasn't pre-screened for critics, opening cold Friday was sort of a hint that it wasn't good and it isn't. There is about one minute with a limbo contest between Freeman and Jones that may give you a hint of a smile but that is it! Freeman fares the best but that is strictly due to his persona. I seldom, if ever, negative about performers looks but I have to make a few general comments here. Both Freeman and Jones are aging fine up to this point but of the women I wish Elizabeth Ashley hadn't appeared on the screen as I once thought this woman was beautiful but, to me, that's not true anymore. I didn't, gratefully, recognize Jane Seymour during the movie and had to check the credits out to see what part she played. I am not just picking on the women as I am still shaking my head over my 'idol', for many reasons, Johnny Mathis! We are both the same age but he looks 20 years older than he should plus the two songs he sang didn't sound like the Mathis I know. Sometimes a movie is so bad it becomes a cult film but this is so bad it should just disappear and never be shown again!",-1

1.0,Arguably one of the worst movies of the year.,-1

0.5,"I honestly think this was the worst movie I have ever seen in a theatre. I jumped in on the first day due to the cast but as much as I love Morgan Freeman I despised his character; over-sexed, manipulative, self-indulgent, etc.... No one's character stayed true to themselves during the whole movie so even the one's I started out liking lost me by the end (except Tommy Lee, I liked him less but still had respect for him). So so disappointed. I still don't know what the point of this movie was past mindless entertainment. The plot was ridiculous and the characters were ridiculous. The best thing about the movie was the location/scenery.",-1
1.0,"A good cast couldn't redeem this movie. What plot there was, was totally thin and not developed, the ending was anti-climactic and it degenerated very quickly into one long senior citizen sex joke. I never thought I would say this about a movie that Morgan Freeman was in, but this one may get noticed by the Razzies.",-1
0.5,This was just a boring move. It was not funny and had no real story.,-1

0.5,Garbage. Never even smiled,-1
3.0,"Put another one in the Christmas movie column. When you get the likes of Morgan Freeman, Tommy Lee Jones and Rene Russo together, the movie practically drives itself. The strength of ""Just Getting Started"" is probably in the execution of the vision of a single creator, that being writer / director Ron Shelton of Bull Durham fame. This one is a fairly light comedy. There are some plot holes. How does the bad guy know where to find the rental truck in order to blow it up? Largely due to chemistry of the 3 lead actors, JGS lands somewhere between not too painful and a hilarious time at the movies.",0

0.5,"I thought it was average when I watched it in 2010, but I revisited it after seeing the excellent 2024 series and realized from the watching that the film is truly abysmal. The series made clear to me everything that is completely wrong in the film, starting from the totally wrong compression of the script, the weak and lazy casting of the actors, the robotic and unmotivated performance of everyone involved, the blurry amateur photography in cold tones (for a wather/ice theme... wow... . groundbreaking), and finally a terribly executed characterization of the actors. In short, the film tries so hard to be original and take itself seriously that due to lack of cohesion and capacity it becomes a dull and forgettable joke.",-1
5.0,"As a fan of the original show, I was dubious about the live action version, but it genuinly hits the high points all across the board. Production quality was on point, the characters for the most part were impressivley accurate and overall, it's just plain enjoyable. Way to go Team Avatar!",1

0.5,"Literally the worst movie I have ever seen, and not just because it ruins a childhood classic. Other terrible movies may be more poorly put together, but you can at least enjoy them by laughing at them. You can't even laugh at Shyamalan's trainwreck.

0.5,This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life. The effects being ok is the only good thing. It's nothing like the show the characters are all wrong.

0.5,"I recently watched the animated series with my two older kids. After finishing that masterpiece, they heard about the live-action adaptation. Having never seen it myself, I thought we might as well give it a chance. I was wrong. I tried to go in with an open mind, but this movie is terrible. The film started with the changed iconic intro, and I knew we were in trouble. I'm not saying that they shouldn't have changed anything. The problem is that they changed the elements that already worked. The name pronunciation (Aang, Iroh, Sokka, etc.) is frustrating and on the verge of laughable. The plot drags, yet skips important points, with Katara's voiceover glossing over key details. Character development is non-existent, with Sokka's character completely devoid of personality. The casting is atrocious, and I cannot think of a single ""hit"" in the group. The acting is bland, and the costumes are even blander. This film had so much potential. A great director, excellent source material and a loyal fanbase. Unfortunately, the phrase ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" was never muttered in the writer's room. The series was full of so much joy and this film is just joyless. Worst Character: Sokka Worst Quote: ""Aang? Can you hear me? I knew you were real. I always knew you'd return."" - Katara Worst Scene: The Earthbender Revolt Best Piece of Score (I actually liked the score): ""Flow Like Water"" Note: Why was there so much movement for minimal bending?",-1

4.0,"I never saw the cartoon so I knew not what to expect, but I was aware of how much the fanbase hated this film. Dev Patel was great as always. The story was well done and the special effects are excellent along with the fight scenes. From what I know, apparently M Night Shymalan took too many liberties with the source material. You can do that, as long as at its core, the new product remains true to the original. This one apparently does not. But I could watch it again and plan to, hopefully. I enjoyed the heck out of it. Had it been an original creation I believe the film would have been a hit and spawned multiple sequels or become a cult classic at the very least. There's a slight chance it could become one if more people who never watched the cartoon catch on and/or the Avatar fanbase becomes more open minded and treats the work like an independent one loosely based on its source material. I guess in the cartoon there is more to Airbending than shown in the film, but the little you do see is very well done and the story is comparatively engaging as James Cameron's Avatar. I think in the future this will find more favor with a different audience. 84/100 B",1

0.5,"The Last Airbender is an abomination of a movie, and a complete disrespect to the beloved animated series it is based on. As someone who has watched the animated show multiple times over the years, this movie adaptation is one of the worst ever made. Even without the comparison to the original, this movie is bad in every aspect. The love and respect for the cultures the original nations were based on is completely absent in this film, due to terrible casting and character pronunciation. The effects are mostly terrible and the story and characters are rushed and overly complex, making it a rushed mess. The acting is terrible, and the directing is worse. The only thing I can give credit to this film is the way the characters move when bending the element, but it is immediately ruined by the terrible effects. Overall, The Last Airbender is a complete failure in every aspect and a disgrace to the beloved animated series.",-1

The best scenes are definitely the ballet recital and the party brawl at the climax. Overall, a good time. Not cinema, but simply amusing entertainment.",0

En mi opini√≥n se destacan las actuaciones de conocido Adam Sandler, Kevin James, David Spade, Chris Rock, Salma Hayek, Cameron Boyce, etc. Por otro lado, los efectos me parecen geniales, esta todo muy bien hecho. Hay que decir que no es una cinta para tom√°rsela en serio ya que su historia no es la gran cosa, solo es algo para pasar un buen rato y creo yo que estas son pel√≠culas infravaloradas y siento que las personas le tendr√≠an que dar una oportunidad.

Little Fockers completely misses the mark with an un-funny re-hashing of the same old ""Jack was in the CSI and is a bit stern"" concept. There's just no drama, no humour, no real point to any of it.

2.0,"Little Fockers is probably the weakest out of the three. The movie's got it's funny moments which involve the characters we all know and all love like Greg (Ben Stiller) and Jack (Robert De Niro). The movie tries a bit too hard to do too many things in just this one movie and some of the funny moments don't end up succeeding so well. Overall, Little Fockers tries to juggle lots of different things in just one movie and it doesn't do as well as it could have. It's got some funny moments but those funny moments should be built up a little bit better and they should try not to throw too much into the movie.",-1
0.5,"This lazy sequel, peppered with tired gags serves as proof that the ""Meet the Parents"" franchise overstayed its welcome.",-1
1.0,"Meet the Parents is a shockingly bad low for the franchise, where it decides to go for gross out humour to appeal to the lowest denominator of the audience but also includes many sexual jokes and plot lines, meaning the tone is off and gives the feeling that the director didn't know what he wanted the film to be. It's a lazy repeat of the movies before and by causing more conflict between Ben Stiller and Robert de Niro's characters (2 incredibly wasted actors like everyone else in this film) means that they learnt nothing from the previous outings, ruining them and making them feel a lot less rewarding. Overall, despite maybe a smile once in a while, Little Fockers is a comedy I would never rewatch or recommend.",-1
1.5,Why not make this a trilogy. This is the worst of the bunch and thank goodness it's the last one.,-1
0.5,I still wonder why Robert de niro makes such a bad movie,-1
3.5,"The film ""Meet the Parents"" was a pleasant comedy about family, love, children and parents. ""Meet the Fockers"" harmoniously continued the story, perfectly complementing it and ending. The third part was not necessary, however, and she is trying to logically continue what she started ten years ago in the first film. Therefore, I will not scold her, but try to find a good continuation in it, because, for me, this trilogy is a complete story. In the first part, the wedding of Sister Pam and the engagement of Pam with Gaylord take place, in the second birth of the child of the sister and the wedding of Pam and in the third divorce of the sister and children of Pam. Do not find a pattern? Pam repeats the fate of his sister from film to film. Engagement, wedding, children, divorce - her sister literally foreshadows everything that will happen to her. And if you pay attention to this red line that runs through the entire trilogy, tension arises in the trikvel: is it possible that Pam's marriage will be destroyed after her sister's marriage, because her life echoed everything in everything? This is the intrigue that all three films brought to. That is the essence of the essence, which can be seen if you watch all three films in a row. In addition, after the topic of the conflict of generations and families, the problem of children and the crisis in relations seems quite logical. Yes, the humor here is weaker than in previous films, the film itself does not look on its own, in contrast to the second part, the actors play clearly without desire (especially Hoffman, who was hardly caught in four small scenes), but I wouldn't for which I did not call this continuation superfluous. Of course, the first two films could do without him, but the triquel is a good complement to the big picture. Moreover, I would not mind seeing the fourth part! After the third, she just begs. Since Gaylord became the father of his daughter, like Jack, I want to see how he will behave in his place. How will Gaylord himself treat his daughter's groom already? Will he remember himself in his face or will he unite with Jack against him? By the way, this will be a real ""Meet the Fockers 2"", only from the reverse side. The circle of life is closed. And, since he also has a son, then he will have to repeat this circle, getting to know the parents of his chosen one, being another Faker. In addition, it would be interesting to look at the matured mini-Jack from the second part as well. I think that after the methods of educating his grandfather, he grew up a very colorful character. In my opinion, all this is a very interesting ending to the story, which may turn out to be much better than this. But judging by the crushing reviews of both critics and viewers, it is unlikely that many will share with me the desire to see the Fockers on the screen again. Oh, so sorry. I put 3.5 for the same film, simply because I consider it as part of the general trilogy, which I generally evaluate as such.",0
3.5,great silly fun with great jokes aimed at the current culture,0
4.0,"I don't think I'll ever understand what critics are expecting when they go into sequels of successful comedy movies. The jokes were always going to be the same flavor, and a lot of the best ones will have already been used. That doesn't make the sequel a pile of crap - we told them with our dollars that we liked their brand of humor and they did us a favor by scraping together another movie like the last one. I actually liked this one better than the last movie, though not quite as much as the first. They minimized my least favorite characters and added more Owen and the plot worked well. The ball pit fight was one of the best scenes in the entire trilogy. The music was noticeably worse, but I think every other category was an improvement.",1

3.0,Not great but not a waste of time,0
1.5,"The tone is all wrong in the final part of this film series in large part due to a change of directors. Not the worst film ever but the weakest of the 3 and largely forgettable. The choices are bizarre for the writers. Instead of having a film about Greg Focker being a new parent with babies they fast forward 5 yrs so he has 5 year old twins...seems like a missed opportunity to me! The film goes back to the confrontational nature of his realationship with his in-laws. Which would have been fine but it's about him being faithful to his wife...and it just sucks the fun out of the whole thing. Also, Owen Wilson is given a larger role than the previous films but his pandering to Greg's father-in-law and wife fall flat here and lack the awkward fun from the first film. He is now friends with Greg instead of a rival so again, it's not fun to watch. Bad choices for the script affected the film and the change in director makes the film feel separate from the first 2 movies.",-1

2.0,"""Little Fockers"", an unnecessary sequel with little to add to the series, is a complete misfire. The jokes are forced, in poor taste, and string together like a collection of crude, unfunny sketches from MAD TV, serving only to further what little plot there is. (The deliverance/plot feels like an a rehashed storyline found in most TV sitcoms.) The characters have worn out their welcome and their performances come off as tired with having little to do to complete the so called ""Focker Trilogy."" Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro provide fine chemistry once again, but its plot is a rehash of its predecessors so we see no new relationships between Greg and Jack (You'd think after 10 years that Jack would finally trust Greg to take care of his daughter!) Owen Wilson is a full fledged character in this installment which works better in doses; Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand are completely wasted and underused; Jessica Alba is completely miscast and comes off as annoying. Underdeveloped story lines/subplots disappear without any closure of what happened in the end (Kids possibly going to the fancy private school, Greg's deal with the Alba and the pharmaceutical drug.)

2.0,"Mediocre third film, Little Fockers really could have been a fun, entertaining movie, but it uses recycled ideas from the two previous movies, and though at times I did laugh, there weren't enough good on-screen jokes to make this a standout comedy worth seeing. The film suffers from a lacking script which just makes the film tedious, and unmemorable. The first two films were great, but with this film the material just doesn't deliver. The humor is predictable, and it's overdone. What they could have done here was keep some of the familiar ground they've established and write new intelligent jokes, instead of exclusively using the old ones. The film just lacks in terms of good story, and everyone involved seems to go through the motions as if they don't care how it ends. Well, Little Fockers ends up being a tiresome film, one that just doesn't deliver anything really funny. Sure, there are a few laughs here and there, but it's not consistent enough to really make this a watchable film. Stick with Meet the Parents instead, it was the best of the trilogy and is still very funny after all these years. Little Fockers is the same old gag and it has become predictable to the point where it's just another comedy sequel that simply doesn't know how to conclude a good trilogy. Little Fockers isn't awful, but it's not good either, it's a mediocre movie, one that that tries too hard at outdoing the first two, and it just doesn't have enough good elements to make this a funny, entertaining comedy. Not awful, but forgettable, Little Fockers should have been much better than this.",-1

4.0,"La primera pel√≠cula fue bastante cuestionable en ciertos aspectos por ser una pel√≠cula de romance o por no cumplir como pel√≠cula er√≥tica, pero no se pod√≠a esperar mucho al tratarse de la primera parte de la trilog√≠a y solo sirvi√≥ como introducci√≥n. Esta segunda parte tiene casi los mismos fallos que la primera, pero hay que admitir que es mejor. Quiz√°s haber cambiado a la directora de la pel√≠cula anterior por el director del cl√°sico At Close Range y hasta haber involucrado a la autora de la novela en la producci√≥n fue un acierto. La pel√≠cula tiene unas pocas mejoras tanto en la historia como en el guion y en el desarrollo de Christian. Muchos han criticado a Christian por las intenciones que ten√≠a con Anastasia en la entrega anterior, pero esta pel√≠cula deja en claro que se trata de alguien con un duro pasado que lo dejo psicol√≥gicamente da√±ado. Siempre se dice que las personas que tienen un da√±o psicol√≥gico que descargan sobre sus parejas siempre usan el trauma para justificar sus acciones. Aunque en parte es cierto, hay hombres que tenemos toda la justa raz√≥n en hacer eso porque necesitamos satisfacer lo que sentimos aunque sea con alguien cercano. Christian act√∫a como si quisiera cambiar, pero la realidad es que los hombres como √©l no cambiamos, solo nos adaptamos al nuevo entorno que nos ofrece una relaci√≥n. Se puede notar que Anastasia tambi√©n se adapta a los gustos de Christian, por m√°s que act√∫e como una mujer que no quiere ser sumisa. Lo cierto es que en una relaci√≥n ninguno puede cambiar aunque lo parezca, lo √∫nico que hacen es adaptarse al entorno del otro y solo el tiempo decide cuanto va a durar eso. Algunos pueden pensar que Christian realmente ama a Anastasia y otros pensaran que solo quiere poseerla. Lo cierto es que Anastasia le ofrece afecto y amor a Christian a pesar de sus gustos. La realidad es que los hombres que podemos parecer fr√≠os, duros, perversos o unos monstruos realmente necesitamos afecto, incluso aquellos que somos incapaces de amar o sentir afecto. Anastasia hace lo correcto en entregarse a Christian porque lo que ella siente por √©l lo ayuda sanar. Ella tambi√©n hace lo correcto en adaptarse a los gustos de Christian porque si realmente amas a alguien, debes aceptarlo tal y como es por m√°s que sea alguien perverso o psicol√≥gicamente inestable. Sin olvidar que satisfacer sus gustos, sin cuestionarlo, tambi√©n deber√≠a ser ley. Esta es sin duda la historia de romance que las chicas de hoy necesitan para darle a gente como Christian Grey ese afecto (y mascota sumisa) que tanto necesitan. Las escenas er√≥ticas tambi√©n son cortas y limitadas, pero se sienten mejores que las que hab√≠a en la pel√≠cula anterior. Aqu√≠ son un poco m√°s cre√≠bles y de haber habido m√°s, esta pel√≠cula quiz√°s pudo haber estado cerca de ser lo que la pel√≠cula anterior no fue. A√∫n hab√≠a m√°s cosas que podr√≠an haber mejorado bastante esta pel√≠cula, como el caso de Leila, que ofrece una cierta intriga. Este personaje sin duda hubiera aportado mucho y es una pena que tambi√©n la hayan limitado. Fifty Shades Darker es una mejora que ofrece un poco m√°s que la primera pel√≠cula, compensa el d√©bil inicio de la trilog√≠a con un mejor acercamiento a la relaci√≥n de los protagonistas y es una pel√≠cula rom√°ntica que hace lo correcto en ense√±ar que los hombres como Christian Grey tienen un lado humano que necesita ser vista, comprendida y aceptada con un coraz√≥n que les ofrezca aquello que nunca tuvieron. Algo que ning√∫n terapeuta jam√°s ser√° capaz de ofrecer. Mi calificaci√≥n final para esta pel√≠cula es un 8/10.",1
5.0,"Showstopping, spectacular. I am a better man having experienced this film. Don't get me wrong: it makes no sense and no three scenes feel like they're from the same film.

1.5,"It's like a bad combo of a Soap Opera, Lifetime Movie, and softcore porn. That's the best way to describe this. Generic music, horrifically bad editing and pacing are really what kills any hope for this. Things just happen and feel so over the top with no real flow or cohesion. If you take one event out like Anna's boss or any of the dragged out sex scenes nothing is really lost. Really the only things that matter is they get bakc together and they get engaged. A whopping 5 minutes worth of actual important story. The rest is so boring and over the top trying to make up for any lack of substance. The acting isn't good mainly because the hcaracter are written terribly and there isn't much to work with. The dialouge is clunky and the motivations are always muddled and unclear. It's never really made clear at the ned of the day why Anna wants to go back with Christian. Christian is wooden and just isn't likeable at all. Everyone else is super forgettable. The cinematography is a big step down from the first one in terms of framing and camerawork and just bad overall. Half the scenes are dimly lit and the rest is just sex scenes that aren't even worth the price of admission. Why watch this when you can just watch free porn. This alternates between befuddled questionable decision drama and dragged out sex scenes. Skip This. They get back together and get engaged. That's all you need to know.",-1

The film delves deeper into their complex relationship, unveiling layers of passion, suspense, and intrigue.

Now it's just a usual boring child story, which pretends to be a erotic movie. If there have been more real sex scenes and not so much kitsch, it would've been ok. But still it isn't so bad, it's ok.

Te puede gustar o no el c√≥mo los personajes se desarrollan, si la relaci√≥n es t√≥xica o no, pero no se puede negar que al igual que la primera parte estas pel√≠culas son una obra t√©cnica, la banda sonora impartida por el legendario Danny Elfman es incre√≠ble, con canciones que realmente logran crean una esencia en la pel√≠cula, que al igual que la primera pasaron a ser un hit, ahora mayormente creadas por Zayn, o por la gran fotograf√≠a de John Schwartzman, el hombre ha trabajado en obras maestras como 'The Rock' o 'Pearl Harbor', y se puede notar en la pel√≠cula, digo hay secuencias fant√°sticas, que desde lo visual son incre√≠blemente buenas. Ese plus en traer a gente s√∫per talentosa para una primicia sencilla dan c√≥mo resultado montajes incre√≠bles que son una pena que sean dedicados para esta pel√≠cula. El mensaje de esta pel√≠cula para mi esta en creer en la 2 oportunidad de los dem√°s, el realmente creer en el cambio de una persona si te importa, se pudo ver desde ambas perspectivas y me parece que para el planeamiento tan superficial o simplista que transmite la pel√≠cula funciona, que no est√° mal, sabemos a lo que vamos, el ver una trama sencilla en la que todos son lo m√°ximo y en enfrentarse a problemas de pareja mientras se ven fabulosos, en el cu√°l me gust√≥ el desarrollo, nos presentan a una Anna empoderada que ya no necesita de Christian aunque √©l si necesite de ella porque encontr√≥ algo m√°s que en lo que cre√≠a que estaba establecido el amor desde su POV, ese cambio de ""roles"" me gust√≥ y me parece que ayudo al dinamismo de la trama. Al igual que con la anterior hay clich√©s que ""funcionan"" para dar avance a la trama c√≥mo el un poco innecesario trasfondo de Christian para que empaticemos con el, o como con el jefe malote de Ana, para crear un conflicto en el que ambos pudieran progresar en su propio desarrollo en la trama. Yo creo que si sabemos ver esta pel√≠culas c√≥mo entretenimiento son buenas, hay un mensaje de empoderamiento de ambos lados en el cual no est√° mal cambiar si la otra persona te interesa pero sin traicionar qui√©n eres, esta pel√≠cula cuenta con una trama que hemos visto m√°s de 100 veces en Netflix, pero con una calidad sobresaliente a lo que estamos acostumbrados de ver en cintas de este g√©nero.",-1

5.0,"This series touched my heart in ways most people can never understand. Having grown up in surrounded by violence and alcoholism I can relate to Christian Grey's character all too well. Especially once you learn about his background and fears of getting attached to anyone. His inability to differentiate violence from love was realistic and extremely sad. I also love Dakota Johnsons sweet, innocent and gentle wittiness. She was cast perfectly for the role of Heroine. The couple was depicted night and day different yet complimented each other in every way. Aside from the unnecessary nudity I found their romance simply moving and beautiful. Im not ashamed to admit I cried like a Sap during the proposal scene in part 2. All in all it came together as a beautiful love story with lots of extra cheesy moments I fell for hook, line and sinker and perhaps a few added cable ties, Duck tape and Rope... The whole serial killer package =)",1
0.5,"Everything that was bad in the first movie, ""Fifty Shades Darker"" does it worse. After the abysmal first movie, I had no expectations for the movie. Of course, after making the right decision at the end of the first, the characters find themselves in the same situation full of bad dialogue, problematic behavior, and no chemistry. This movie even more so feels like a series of boring plot points that never quite come together in any way shape or form. I don't see how this movie can be entertaining for anyone, I felt bored out of my mind getting through it. Overall, it is another baffling movie that exercised my patience and features everything I hated about the first but much worse.

0.5,"What a letdown...but funny in the worst way? I saw it and yeah...I had fun, laughing I guess? For anyone who tells me that its a beautiful, love story...f*ck off. It was the cheesiest, corniest, most awkward-comedic film. But hey, it worked for a great comedy where the jokes on the film. Seriously, the scenes were so bad you couldn't help but laugh. I think FSoG was better in the aspect to take it a bit more ""serious"" than FSD. This film completely did not give a f*ck, I was disappointed that the plots and other characters (Mrs. Robinson, Jack Hyde, Leila) were weak! It had potential to explore more of these arcs, but it didn't. It was dull and so rushed! Everything was rushed. Even the sex! I'm not expecting full-blown porn but cut the soundtrack songs out, more positions (not just mostly missionary all the time), and please bring in some foreplay. How can a movie about risqu√© intimacy not show good foreplay? Why does Christian always have an un-emotional face while having sex? No climax either? In the books, wasn't he always grinning (or proudly smiling) for his accomplishment in giving Ana orgasms? For getting off too? None of that...it cuts straight to the next scene. Man...and why was it so Soap-Opera-ish? I'm not going to lie, I read the trilogy once and I was like, ""whatever, this is the junk food to my brain"". It wasn't good, but whatever... it served some purpose. Did I think that it was the greatest love story? Nope. Did I think it was a great romantic story? Nope. I was honestly intrigued by the fetish that surrounds BDSM. But it turned out, that even if the sex was hot, it wasn't even portrayed properly. BDSM is a whole other level. I was walking out and a lot of the viewers said that it did poorly in capturing the book. Like sure, the sex was there, but that connectivity...intimacy... was not. It was like : fight, bang (sex). Argument, bang. Present, bang again. It was repetitive in the sense of just make-up sex all the time. Ana is annoying. She doesn't know what she wants in the film or in life. Its like she can't take Christian's dark ways and not kidding, a few seconds later she's okay with it, without any solidifying reason (unless its going down on her or sex) . I feel like FSoG (2015) attempted some direction towards a woman's viewpoint. Like Ana being ""dominant"" in the sense of negotiation and choices. In this film, I'm sorry...she comes off like a gold-digger. She comes off like the only reason she's with him is because he's rich. Its like ""I can't be with you, like this...(he gives her a gift), oh, I love you!) WTF? She tries so hard to be her own woman, but really ends up being Christian's (and not in the cute way like ""Oh, I'm his girl *googly-eyes*) I feel that FSoG (2015) did a better job in where Ana had control and it made sense. Here it's wishy-washy. Its just a mess, not sexy, everything is rushed that you don't understand the reasoning behind motives. They cut off and rushed great moments and characters that could have given the film more sense, romance and great eroticism. Yes its funny because it tries so hard to take itself serious. But that's about it.",-1

The music was excellent again, and a bit more noticeable this time too. The addition of Basinger was great. There were still a lot of areas that could've been improved though - nearly all the characters seemed to be brooding in one way or another that tells me they probably had their emotions explained in more detail in the novels. The helicopter crash should've been a bigger portion of the movie than the ~5 minutes that it got. There were not nearly enough crescendos in the plot to justify the running time, causing the overall feeling to be that it was quite melodramatic.",0

If you have no choice and you are forced to watch this bile on film, try to remember this whole fifty shades of horror began as a fan fiction for the equally horrible Twilight series... so imagine this whole thing as that doofus that plays Edward and that seething ball of depression that plays Bella.

1.5,"Yes, it's terrible, but it's also laughable. In many ways, Fifty Shades Darker is worse than the first film, particularly the writing. Though the chemistry between Johnson and Dornan has improved, the movie has also completely removed all the dramatic stakes that the first film had. In the first film, the couples wanted to be together despite their incompatibility and ultimately separated because of their differences. In Fifty Shades Darker, their differences are resolved very early in the movie, so there's no need to root for them for the rest of the film. Though it's great to see a couple in a healthy relationship, it also makes for a really uninteresting movie, especially when you don't care about any of the characters. Anastasia's little personality that she had in the first film is now stripped away as she conforms herself to Christian Grey, who (despite giving up his BDSM lifestyle to be with Anastasia) is still the same manipulative control freak that he was in the first film. Anastasia doesn't know what she wants in this movie. First, she tells him she wants to take it slow after they got back together, and then they have sex in the same scene. She's also very nostalgic about the red room. There's a scene that bothered me where Christian Grey transfers $24,000 into Anastasia's bank account after they had sex (the same sex scene described in the last paragraph). In the next scene, they're at a coffee shop and Christian invites Anastasia to a ball, but she tells him she doesn't have the dress for it. Bitch, he just gave you $24,000! Don't tell him you don't have a dress for the ball when he gave you $24,000. Every men in Fifty Shades Darker are all creepy. For some reason, Jose is back (the guy who forced himself onto Anastasia in the previous film) and Anastasia is still friends with him. My favourite character in the move is Anastasia's sexually harassing boss named Jack (played by Eric Johnson), who gets instantly jealous when he sees Anastasia with Christian Grey, and also tried to force himself onto her. His character was ridiculously over-the-top and hilarious. I think Fifty Shades Darker is the only film where I found sexual harassment funny. I hope Eric Johnson gets more screen time in Freed as he's the only reason why I have an iota of interest in the next film. Sexual harassment is obviously no laughing matter, but it's impossible to take Fifty Shades Darker seriously as there are many pointless subplots in the film. There are flashbacks of Grey being abused as a child, a subplot involving his ex-girlfriend who's jealous of Anastasia, and a helicopter crash where Grey miraculously survives. Fifty Shades Darker was also written by E. L. James's husband, Niall Leonard. Kelly Marcel and Sam Taylor-Johnson (writer and director of the first film) at least tried to subvert the ridiculousness of the source material. There was no doubt that creative differences led to the change in the creative team, and I knew this change would make the movie worse. Niall Leonard and director James Foley will, unfortunately, return for the third and final film. Though Fifty Shades Darker is worse than the first film, I enjoyed it more because of it. It's the best comedy of 2017 next to The Bye Bye Man. Even if you didn't like the first film, I would still recommend Fifty Shades Darker to those who enjoy terrible movies.",-1
3.5,"I've heard so many different opinions about this movie, which I totally understand because it's just not for everyone I guess. I must say though that my opinion is quite positive. I found Fifty Shades Darker to be an enjoyable movie. I started this film with the question ""How am I going to watch this for two hours?"" but it ended before I realised it. First off, let me say, I am a sucker for all things romantic and I think the Fifty Shades movies are that as well. It's all quite a cliche (another thing that I love) and in some cases that comes with a not so great storyline. Fifty Shades Darker is one of those cases. What made this movie an good movie, in my opinion, are the actors and the camera work. The only actress that was a bit of a disappointment for me was Dakota Johnson. She was a great Ana in the first film but I feel like she decided to put a lot more of herself into Ana which kind of bothered me. I was pleasantly surprised by Eric Johnson, whom I've only seen in Hallmark movies. Jamie Dornan is always great so, don't have much more to add to that, ha. The camera work and all the sets were great tho. Grey's apartment, I mean, yas. Yup. I enjoyed it and I'm probably gonna watch it again someday. #noshame",0

The musical choices are hip, light, and sexy; and, the sweeping views of the luxurious life are just nice to look at. Female fantasy movies are fun to imagine are happening to you. Or fun to giggle at with friends. Who wouldn't enjoy a model hot 27 year old millionaire boyfriend who buys you electronics, ball gowns, sports cars and diamonds? Who takes you sailing and flying and fine dining, all while telling you everything you want to hear. Who defends you in a paternal and possessive and flattering way. Of course that doesn't exist, and the insane reasoning for why he became dominant is all wrong. But still... it's fun. You never get tired of looking at Anastasia. Just gorgeous and vulnerable with a light girlish whispery voice. This was the most fun of the three movies and the sex scenes aren't too embarrassing, surprisingly soft core. I think some women are intrigued by the concept of bdsm but not ready to see a movie about it. If you ARE ready, watch ""Secretary"" with Maggie Gyllenhall.

The story was more powerful, but sometimes it made no sense, and it takes us to the things that were worse than the first one: The story sometimes made no sense. Like how Leila was really a slave to Christian? And how did she enter the apartment? A lot of nonsense shit happened!

0.5,"Take out your anal beads and be as aroused as that time you went to a funeral. 50 SHADES DARKER I don't know where to start. I would be lying if I said I'd walked in with high expectations for this ""film"". Look, I saw the first one and it made me barf inside my own soul. But this one takes atrocious to a whole new level. I consider myself a positivist when it comes to movies but there are not many redeemable qualities about this washed up sequel. Firstly, the trailers made it look like a Eyes Wide Shut kind of movie, clearly hinting at a secret society of some sorts which is never even grazed on. Secondly, going from both a female director and screenwriter to male ""filmmakers"" was a lunatic decision! The direction is astoundingly deficient, and it's topped by any celebrities' sex tape; the editing is bizarre and the script... the script is something out of this world! I do realize that much of the fault can be attributed to that senseless women E. L. James' source material but the script has no idea of how humans interact and what's behind characters' decision. Watching Christian and Anastasia talking is as awkward as that time you first tried role playing, but this time there's no happy ending. There's so much in this ""film"" that is laughable and unbearable that I often found refuge in checking if that Exit sign was still there. What's more, the sex scenes weren't even exciting! It felt like the whole movie was constructed around them, as they don't seem to communicate with the scenes that come before or after them. The sex was so boring and misplaced and made two attractive people feel like they were taken off Battleship Earth. Furthermore, the performances are shocking, what is that? The lack of life, intonation and nuance from both actors should trigger a mechanism for them to be expelled from Hollywood. Trump, take notice! These ""filmmakers"" and actors are the ones you should be deporting! But wait, there's more! And this one is a biggie. What's more infuriating about this sequel is that it is incredibly misogynistic. It's off the wall when a movie that's so clearly marketed to women is also deeply degrading to them. First, no one and I say no one would come back to him time and time again, no matter how cute the puppy eyes and second, it's the 21st century and, guess what, you don't need a man to make it through life. This film reinforces so many stereotypes like the notion that the woman should be submissive in bed and in the relationship, that conversation is mediated by the man, that the women can't protect themselves from the harsh world out there and that objectification is acceptable. And yet, to try to compensate this, Anastasia says ""no, I order for myself"" and ""no, I don't want you anymore"" and ""ew, my boss wants to rape me"" because god forbid there's a man that doesn't want to have sex with white bread Dakota. To all women out there, if you go watching this film with your boyfriend or girl friends, you are encouraging the perpetuation of resolute gender roles in our society, you're giving the man the power to choose for you and you're allowing misogyny to grow. This film represents everything that's wrong with mass female-targeted entertainment and it's like what a straight guy thinks being screwed in the butt feels like.",-1

0.5,WOW was that painful. Every 20 minutes or so LET‚ÄôS F*#K! And darker? How is this darker? This is a trilogy that could‚Äôve been a single 90 minute film and would‚Äôve been more entertaining that way.,-1
0.5,"A second adaptation that was just as bad as the first one if not more and a pointless excuse to show off a boring love story with boring sex scenes and terrible music to go along with those sex scenes. I hated this ""film"" from start to finish just like the first one and there was absolutely nothing to complement about it whatsoever. Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson give off the most uninteresting love story I've seen in quite a while and it lacks any sort of actual love, charisma, or personality to it. It was just rubbish to watch unfold and I have seen better sex scenes in PG-13 movies than in this R rated film. The dialogue was also just completely terrible and I found myself sighing in annoyance with the worst lines and laughing at the most serious moments. From what I heard about the books, they were also horribly written and I can't imagine those being worse than the movies. There is no weight to the film it's completely dull in every sense, the director James Foley of the really good Glengarry Glen Ross directs the film awfully making it one of the most boring films I had ever seen, and gifted composer Danny Elfman creates his most by-the-numbers music in these movies. When the movie maybe presents something that could be interesting, it is thrown to the wayside to show more boring ass scenes of more romancing, kissing, and sex. Great actresses like Kim Basinger and Marcia Gay Harden are wasted in forgettable and useless roles. Overall, this is the second time in a row that these stars and filmmakers have crafted something completely awful and I do not look forward to what they have in store for the hopefully final chapter in Fifty Shades Freed.",-1
1.0,"I got Six minutes in......SIX MINUTES!!! AND I realised I had made a mistake. Not about saying this is the worst movie of 2017 Cause it is. But the fact that I would sit and watch it in the first place dear god! SHAME!!! And apparently their is a longer version....... Like the first one their is no plot. Serious. No Plot at all. The Creepy guy from the first one takes photos of her and puts them up in a gallery with out ""her"" knowledge, and we will put this up there right now I did not learn any of the other characters names throughout this because all they say is ""Anna"" and ""Christian"" that is it! Oh and ""Mother"" that is it! So creepy guy has a gallery exhibit of ""Anna"" where ""Christian"" buys all of the large size photos, which is even more creepier! He arrives looking like a homeless guy and some how after breaking up after the first one she agrees to have diner with him after at first he just wanted to talk and I lost any level of interest after that. Oh and the new boss is also a creep to. But they are saving that for the next one....SERIOUSLY MORE OF THIS CRAP! Remember the tv show baywatch? this is basically that......talking, talking, talking, Montage, and back to talking. Except replace slow mode running montage with a sex scene montages that pushing for an R rating but just doesn't make it.... and it is boring, really boring. There is stalker ex sub plot that could be really interesting and it literally fizzles out just as quick as it starts. Same again with a helicopter crash scene with ""Christian"" involved it begins AND just as quick it is gone! Been told again and again and again, ""If you read the books you will understand"" But a good adaptation like Harry Potter, Jurassic Park, You Before Me anything like that you should just sit there and watch it and not have to get it where this is just ... I don't know it seems like expensive set pieces thrown at the production company and said you use these and we will pay you to use them and just make a reason to have them in it....and the reason is.....just cause..... No chemistry, nothing really interesting about that world, The writing........get this the screenplay was done by the husband of the writer of the book....Who seems to have no other credits to his name other than Husband of the writer...WOW. Oh god, the third is coming.... 1 Star for Danny Elfmans music.",-1
4.0,"Better than the first one. We see the effort to try to show more than the first by keeping the same audience. More mystery and thrilling, Darker is satisfying. The next one should be greater by the way.",1
2.5,"no rules, no punishments.. Fifty Shades Darker The plot has a lot to offer but it lacks character development and worst of all execution which just results into dull and dry emotions and addition to that the lead actors lacks acting skills.",-1

5.0,I loved this movie. I've seen alot of bad reviews but I have to say watching them fall in love was great it was so much better than the 1st movie.,1
2.5,Honestly a little better than the first and this one had some different story lines in there other than just two people going at it for 2 hours. Interested in seeing how the third movie wraps the whole series up since I won't be reading the books,-1
1.0,Typical filler sequel that nudges the characters along without really having much of an impact on the overall story. Laughable continuation of a franchise that nobody asked for.,-1
2.5,"Mostly feels like a rehash of the previous movie for the first half with some various new elements. Then it changes it up a bit, goes into soap opera territory but you know.. with lots of raunchy sex scenes as to be expected. I'm honestly surprised I don't hate these movies. Suppose I'll have to see what happens in the final part of the trilogy because damn my curiosity.",-1

5.0,Best movie out there!! Everything is amazing! hey,1
0.5,"This one is even worse than part 1. Read my review of that first one and imagine it being a) even more generic chick flick, b) even more predictable and c) even more lacking in narrative and actual content. It's like a teenager's boring love diary with a semi-kinky page or two sprinkled in plus a set-up with a vengeful villain for part 3. Can't wait for more corny lines, lip biting, super-kinky handcuffs and a story that goes nowhere. Five thumbs down. Avoid!",-1

2.0,"There's a particular adage describing how the certain solid material looks of the top of the septic tank. This is a crude analogy to use about a movie, but in this instance, the consensus is accepted. The movie represented by the waste material in this comparison is 'Fifty Shades Darker,' the second in a trilogy of the movie adaptation of the best-selling novels written by E. L. James. Audiences around the world have already been afflicted with the opening salvo on this front, good taste 'Fifty Shades of Grey,' and undoubtedly have 'Fifty Shades Freed,' in the foreseeable future. Some may understandably wonder how it will be so universally panned by critics could be assured filling out a complete trilogy of movies. The movie of the consideration at an estimated budget of some $55 million over most of it was recouped on opening night eventually starting to well over double the investment without even considering income derived from Blu-ray/DVD and cable licensing fees. Unless you've been living in a pop-culture free environment for the last two years you undoubtedly aware of the fundamental plot of the series of movies, and perhaps a specific focus of the second film. The story follows a rather na√Øve young woman drawn into the influence of a man who is wealthy and powerful and also quite into the sexual practice known as BDSM, a.k.a. Bondage, discipline, sadomasochism. In the first story, the powerful man in the designated damsel restricts their pursuit of fetishism to the bedroom. Now, take the show on the road and explore various establishments and groups with devotees of the practice and gathered together. Since the subject matter so overly sexualized it would be a completely natural conclusion to expect a substantial amount of nudity. Right up front, it should be noted that only an estimated 9% of the film is over sexual content. That's less than 12 minutes of a running time of the 118 minutes. Back when I was a kid, long before the age of the Internet, you check the Catholic newspaper, The Tablet, for films listed as condemned by the Church. They were the ones we would inevitably try to see the next weekend. Even by the puerile standards of the 60s, teenage boys would be disappointed in the eroticism of this movie. This story moves directly into some of the psychological and emotional influences that help shape the sexual predilections of Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). After breaking up with his girlfriend, the enigmatic Mr. Grey begins experiencing intense nightmares forcing him to revisit the abuse he suffered as a child. Meanwhile, his former liaison, Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is moving on with her life including a new job as an assistant for an editor at Seattle Independent Publishing, Jack Hyde (Eric Johnson). Since this story is ostensibly a romance, albeit a very unorthodox variation, it should come as no surprise that Mr. Hyde is interested in Ana. Initially, the dramatic motivation was whether or not Ana was given to the seductive Mr. Grey. In an attempt to change the underlying narrative reflects a slightly different direction; Christian now has a romantic rival adding to his concerns. Even the worst movies can contain a few aspects properly handled. To the credit of the screenwriter, Niall Leonard, the time is wasted to reunite Mr. Grey and Ms. Steele. Ana was attending an art gallery show featuring a friend of hers, Jose Rodriguez' (Victor Rasuk). Among the other guests she happens to spot Christian Grey, and after a bit small talk, she reluctantly agrees to go to dinner with him. Any reasonable person would hear his voice in the back of the head screaming while watching this point of the film, which after everything that happened in the previous movie why would she risks falling back into the same routine. The answer is quite simple. If she declined the invitation, the movie would probably qualify as a short. It is the most blatant of plot contrivances but considering the overall quality and veracity of the story any complaints would be meaningless. Christian does make the requisite plea to accept his offer by stating that he has changed. If you saw this in the theater and happened to look around at this moment, you undoubtedly see every woman's head nodding in disbelief. The movie proceeds to construct an overly convoluted tangle of interrelationships. Ana encounters a woman who looks strikingly similar to her later when she's having drinks with Jack; conveniently Christian is there as well. When he witnesses Jack's Cretaceous attitude towards Ana, he abruptly leaves taking Ana with him explaining that her boss at less than honorable intentions but is not so innocent flirting. Christian explains to her that this company has been seriously considering taking over SIP. That would ensure that Christian would not be out of Ana's life anytime soon. He also revealed her that the woman she saw him with that look similar to her was Leila Williams, portrayed by Jazmine Campanale, Ms. Johnson's stand-in. He explained that she was one of his former submissiveness demonstrating that he obviously has a particular physical type that he finds attractive. To infuse a modicum of suspense into the proceedings, Christian provides a bit of the woman's back story. After leaving him, she got married, but recently her husband died. Since then she has taken upon herself to stalk Ana and Christian. If it weren't for the fact that Christian was a man, this tale of his scarring childhood would be consistent with a Lifetime movie. His mother was a prostitute addicted to crack in his birth mother committed suicide. As a child, he was taken in by Grace Trevelyan Grey (Marcia Gay Harden), who eventually adopted him. Later on, Ana meets a woman Christians past, Elena Lincoln (Kim Basinger), who is Christian's business partner and former dominant. To keep things, spicy turns out the Christian life to be not just on the giving side of S&M at the receiving side as well. The big scene that dominated the trailers is the BDSM masquerade ball. The setting, obviously inspired by the central sexual intrigue for Stanley Kubrick's final film, 'Eyes Wide Shut.' I always enjoy a movie that requires the audience to devote their attention to the storyline. It is exciting to see various threads of the story become woven together as the narrative progresses. Instead of individual threads of a beautiful tapestry, the elaborate nature of the story closely resembles a tango Christmas tree lights when you retrieve them from storage in December. Just as that inexorable morass of wires and bulbs promised to be something special, the only thing that provided is frustration, disillusionment, and disappointment. Obviously, there is a fan base for this series of movies is evident not only by the box office success despite being dismissed by critics but also the best-selling status of the novels. The main difference between the three books in the franchise and the Pope Romance novels so popular for women to read on the beach that the 'Shades of Grey' stories were published in hardcover conferring upon them a semblance of literary worth. I happen to agree with what many people have noted that if you want to watch an erotic drama, you will find more success watching Cinemax After-Hours than anything this movie can offer. The movie is available in Ultra high definition, 4K, in case you are inclined to spend even more to have the video as sharp as currently available.",-1
4.5,Thought it was pretty good. Not as steamy as the book but I enjoyed watching it.,1
1.5,"Darker by named but not necessarily by nature, the follow up to Fifty Shades Of Grey manages to be far more complicated than its predecessor, but somehow ends up being just as dull. The acting, especially from the lead couple, hasn't improved, the writing isn't any more insightful or less laughable, and the plot isn't any less repetitive. You could play a drinking game while watching it and do a shot for every time Christian steps out of a black SUV, every time he and Ana attend a fancy party, every time they text each other, every time they sleep together and every time a question is asked that either never gets answered or simply leads to more questions. The first movie's biggest sin was that it was boring, and this one, while still having its sporadically interesting moments, also can't disguise the blatant flaws of its source material. Why does Ana do such a quick U-turn when it comes to how she feels about Christian? One minute she wants nothing to do with him, then she can't stand to be away from him for a second? And why is Christian so able to completely give up the only life he's known because of a single person he has nothing in common with? It's completely nonsensical, and a cheap excuse to film a series of sex scenes which don't even, ahem, climax, instead just ending with a jump cut to a completely location. It has no reason to be nearly 2 hours long, but manages to pad itself out with a helicopter crash of all things, and one in which nobody suffers more than superficial injuries. It's like even the movie had no idea where to go and panicked when it realised there was still time left to fill. Mercifully there's only 1 film left, and while it might be the best in the trilogy, that is a very low bar to clear.",-1
5.0,"Even better than Fifty Shades of Grey , . . though a bit short on whips and chains. Dornan and Johnson torch the screen! Support cast is a definite plus. Well written, acted, filmed and edited . . . leaving loyal viewers waiting with bated breath for the grand finale. Wake me when it's on 4k.",1
2.5,"I am beyond torn with this movie. On one hand, I was excited to see it. I have watched it many times since it's release both in the theater and, by DVD... And each time one scene comes into play, my heart speeds up because, in my mind, I know how the scene is supposed to play out and then... I cringe. I know it is coming. I know the same results are going to happen each time but, my mind, knowing the books, knowing how the director -should- have directed Jamie to perform... I have this pain in my soul because Jamie is a great actor. I just think this was not the right part for him. I can forgive that the movie didn't really follow the book. So that was a let down from the start however, the idea is there, and so I can forgive that but, as a fan of the book... yes, I can hear your collective groans, I really had high hopes after seeing Jamie cast as this character until... that.. one.. scene. The scene... spoiler(ish) alert. Anna has just come back from her ""walk"" after the Lyla incident. Christain and Anna are having it out over whether or not Anna can fullfill his needs, and Christain, being afraid that Anna is leaving him, submits to her, by kneeling in front of her. In the movie, this is all done with barely any feeling, and so nonchalantly, I honestly wondered if either Jamie or the director had bothered to read the series or not. In the book.. Christain is panicked. He is scared. His emotions, which he has no experience dealing with, are flying all over the place! His heart is breaking into a million pieces, and he feels like he is losing everything, all because he, in his mind, is a monster, one which Anna could never love. That raw emotion. In the books, he is fighting, arguing, crying, begging. He is completely NOT himself. And suddenly. It all stops, and he throws himself down on his knees. Completely submission. Docile. That pain, and emotion, and loss... Jamie just doesn't deliver it. The thing is, with the proper direction, he could have gotten there!!! This is something that bothers me with many directors. It's THEIR JOB to get the correct response from their actors. There are so many scenes from both movies that I could dissect like this... however, this was the most disappointing scene in ALL of the movies Jamie Dornan has been in. It honestly makes me so angry when I see an actor's potential hidden, and screwed with like this. As for my mental and almost physical response to this scene... as I said, I am a fan of the series. Sure it's about D/S relationships but, that is not what I got from the series. There was so much more than just sex. And, I tend to lose myself in books. If I can connect with the characters than I feel that is a great experience with the authors. I find it a disservice to the author, as well as the actors. This could have been an amazing movie, if the actors had just had a better more attentive director. And, just to point out, I am not saying that maybe the director hasn't had other hits... to be honest, I didn't look into it because of this epic fail at directing THIS film... but, I think that the director failed this movie. Sigh... that is all I will say. For now. Hey, there is another movie still to come. See you all then!",-1
1.0,"It's not even bad enough to be funny, it's not good enough to be entertaining, it's not interesting enough to be worth your time.

5.0,This film was a great improvement from the first. I recommend people give this a chance. The chemistry is amazing between jamie and Dakota. They covered the books rarely well.

I still think dispight that huge storyline left out they worked the film out amazingly without it. Looking forward to the next one.,1

Its not entertaining, interesting nor and more importantly steamy! Don't get me wrong there is PLENTY of Dakota Johnson on display but the way its filmed takes any excitement from the expected scenes. Then we have to address the chemistry between the two leads. There is none (well not until one tiny sequence near the end of the film) Mr Dornan's lack of interest in his role continues from the first film but what is new is that Miss Johnson seemingly has given up and is just ""phoning it in"" to complete the contract as quickly as possible. I know there are fans of the books which have been waiting for this film and I would advise to keep it in your mind and avoid at all costs!",-1

4.0,"La trilog√≠a de E.L. James concluye enfoc√°ndose m√°s al romance y menos en el erotismo. Todo comienza despu√©s de ver a Christian y Anastasia casarse. Se puede notar que finalmente aprendieron a aceptarse y adaptarse el uno al otro. Christian a√∫n tiene sus gustos, pero se lo nota m√°s sentimental como Anastasia. Por otro lado, Anastasia se la ve m√°s atrevida habiendo aceptado los gustos de Christian y hasta se puede notas que Anastasia se ha vuelto un poco m√°s parecida a Christian. Ella igual sigue siendo la chica con aire de inocencia que solo quiere tener un final feliz. Todo va bien hasta que llega Hyde a complicar las cosas. La pel√≠cula anterior fue una introducci√≥n para este personaje porque aqu√≠ empieza a cumplir un rol antag√≥nico importante. Eso fue algo que hac√≠a falta para mejorar un poco la trama de la trilog√≠a y poder darle una conclusi√≥n m√°s llamativa. En parte funciona, pero se tendr√≠a que haber agregado m√°s momentos de Hyde porque pudo haber ayudado a dar m√°s intriga a la pel√≠cula. Hyde es un elemento fundamental porque se vuelve clave para la liberaci√≥n de Christian y haber explorado m√°s a este personaje hubiera ayudado a pesar de que lo que pasa en los √∫ltimos momentos de pel√≠cula era algo que pod√≠a deducir. Las escenas er√≥ticas son pocas y m√°s suaves. Aqu√≠ quer√≠an enfocarse m√°s en las emociones de la pareja y su nueva etapa como reci√©n casados. Es cierto que Christian llega a ponerse un poco pesado, pero es por lo mucho que se preocupa por Anastasia con todo el asunto de Hyde. La pel√≠cula hace bien en enfocarse bastante en el lado humano de Christian y se puede decir que encuentra un cierto alivio en su matrimonio, ya que la pel√≠cula anterior era para entender las sombras que lo atormentaban y en esta pel√≠cula Christian es finalmente liberado de esas sombras. Claro que sucede de una manera r√°pida y sencilla y un poco m√°s de profundidad hubiera aportado. Si hay algo que se puede acreditar de esta pel√≠cula es que supo retratar de una manera realista lo que pasa despu√©s del matrimonio o el cl√°sico ""vivieron felices para siempre"". Todo inicia bien, luego vienen las primeras complicaciones y despu√©s viene la reconciliaci√≥n para no perder a esa persona que amas y te da ganas de seguir viviendo. Los flashbacks de las pel√≠culas anteriores vistos al momento de concluir la historia generan un cierto aire de ternura, d√°ndole a la pel√≠cula una buena conclusi√≥n. La moraleja de esta historia es que los hombres como Christian Grey son ese pr√≠ncipe azul que las j√≥venes como Anastasia realmente necesitan y que lo visto en esta pel√≠cula es el final que todas ellas merecen. No es exactamente el final m√°s conmovedor que se pudo haber hecho, pero se agradece que esta pel√≠cula haya tenido menos fallas que las pel√≠culas anteriores. En conclusi√≥n, Fifty Shades Freed finaliza la trilog√≠a de una manera bastante regular debido a que se pudo haber agregado m√°s para que fuera un final m√°s emocionante, pero es satisfactoria la forma en que concluye la historia de amor entre Christian y Anastasia haciendo que ellos dos tengan un lindo final feliz. Mi calificaci√≥n final para esta pel√≠cula es un 8/10.",1

5.0,"I'm really pleased to see Mr. and Mrs. Grey leading a family life in this installment. It's a significant improvement over the first two Fifty Shades movies. ""Freed"" is now my personal favorite. It conveys a powerful message on how to love a challenging man in the context of these films. Love triumphs in the end. Surprisingly. It reminds us that we all have hidden secrets that can be our downfall and wounds that take time to heal. Finding someone who accepts you as you are is a testament to true love. While I acknowledge that the movie wasn't flawless, I believe the relationships depicted in the Fifty Shades series weren't perfect either. Lastly, I must say the soundtracks in the Fifty Shades movies were truly worth it.",1

3.0,"Con esta tercera entrega enriendo porque hay tanta gente incluy√©ndome que tenemos a esta saga c√≥mo ""gusto culposo"", y es que afirmo que estas pel√≠culas saben distinguirse de todas las pel√≠culas rom√°nticas er√≥ticas que hay por montones, la fotograf√≠a es brutal, el soundtrack es incre√≠ble con covers c√≥mo canciones originales teniendo artistas incre√≠bles c√≥mo Ellie Goulding y Dua Lipa entre otros, y la historia siento que es muy entretenida, no es el tri√°ngulo amoroso visto hasta el cansancio con sub arcos que tengan que involucrar de manera descarada la masculinidad del protagonista, y no digo que esta saga tenga una historia incre√≠ble pero siento que las 3 son muy entretenidas y aunque por momentos recaen en estos estereotipos la honestidad con la que se expresan tanto Jamie Dornan c√≥mo Dakota Johnson hacen que aunque sepas que est√°n mal entiendas su punto. La trama se basa en c√≥mo tanto Christian c√≥mo Ana han dado un cambio en su vida de 360 grados, con todo lo que ello implica, otro estilo de vida c√≥mo as√≠ adaptarse en la personalidad por momentos tan dispar que tienen con la otra persona, teniendo que ambos aprender a soltar si quieren que la relaci√≥n funcione. En la que la misma trama rompe con el esquema de hombre idealizado y de cierta forma ""perfecto"" que se hab√≠a presentado con anterioridad a Christian, al ser expuesto cuando su compa√±√≠a falla, y al ser robados datos personales suyos importantes, donde las mismas inseguridades con Anastasia que ten√≠an en las pel√≠culas anteriores siguen igual o hasta en aumento, siendo una desvoluci√≥n algo forzada del personaje para volver a los mismos tropos que hab√≠an funcionado tan bien en las otras pel√≠culas, pero ahora con la diferencia de que a pesar de todas las comodidades que ahora tiene Anastasia no se siente ella misma, ya sea por el cambio tan abrupto en su entorno, en el que incrementan las envidias externas por creer que todo se le ha facilitado por Christian, ya sea por su nuevo puesto en el trabajo o la vida aparentemente ""perfecta"" que tiene, ya sea exponi√©ndolo involuntariamente c√≥mo tener un guardia que la sigue a todos lados; y ah√≠ para mi es donde entra Hyde en la historia, este personaje que funge como principal conflicto en la historia, en que de cierta manera expone la fragilidad en la relaci√≥n de Christian y Anastasia, desde un apartado ego√≠sta, por creer que merece las mismas oportunidades que tiene Christian, d√≥nde es hasta el tercer acto que entendemos m√°s esa represi√≥n interna. Partiendo de ah√≠ para ambos darse cuenta de los problemas de hasta ese momento ""perfecta"" relaci√≥n, en la que se indaga m√°s en lo superficial de la misma, ya que cuando hay un problema serio la misma tiende a desmoronase, siendo en este caso la llegada de un beb√© en la que ambos para ese momento no estaban ni en disposici√≥n ni listos, aumentando la tensi√≥n con la constante auto dependencia de Christian hacia Anastasia. Siendo fundamental el c√≥mo lo resolver√°n, ya sea ambos juntos o cada uno por un camino diferente. Siento que, aunque obvio tiene que haber escenas de sexo por la primicia de la misma pel√≠cula si me parece que rompen con lo bien que construye la trama, que s√≠, no es fenomenal, pero es entretenida, pero s√≠ me parece que le acaba afectando sobre todo en el segundo acto cuando m√°s informaci√≥n es expuesta al espectador. Que la pel√≠cula intente resolver el conflicto con un secuestro por un loco c√≥mo Hyde, se siente algo forzado, d√≥nde me parece que lo resuelven de una buena manera, pero si lo sientes c√≥mo un deux ex machina para fortalecer la relaci√≥n de amos, que repito, no es malo de echo es bueno, pero no se siente org√°nico en la trama. Mediante la resoluci√≥n del secuestro de Mia la pel√≠cula culmina con un final muy redondo para la trilog√≠a, me gust√≥ el c√≥mo se cerr√≥, haciendo un recordatorio por todas las cosas buenas y no tan buenas por las que tuvieron que pasar en todo este tiempo, sintetizando lo fuerte de su relaci√≥n con la llegada del beb√©. Lo que me gust√≥ mucho del tercer acto est√° en involucrar una conexi√≥n tan grande entre Christian y Hyde, volviendo nuevamente endeble a la figura de Christian, lo cual lo humaniza al darse cuenta que el ""villano"" de la cinta vino literal del mismo lugar que √©l y c√≥mo el tal vez si no lo hubieran adoptado a √©l y se hubieran inclinado por Hyde su vida podr√≠a haber acabado igual, aunque se cierra de una forma muy √≠ntima entre √©l y Anastasia en el que le menciona que aunque lo hubiera elegido a √©l la diferencia tan marcada de ideales entre uno y otro habr√≠a hecho la diferencia, siendo para m√≠ un √∫ltimo di√°logo muy bien estructurado con el conflicto principal de la misma. Esta pel√≠cula a pesar de no tener las escenas visualmente m√°s incre√≠bles de la trilog√≠a, creo que es la que tiene la historia m√°s honesta, que s√≠, se basa en clich√©s y giros de trama predecibles (a excepci√≥n del √∫ltimo que fui muy fan), pero en general creo que la historia si sabe c√≥mo cautivar al espectador. Sabiendo c√≥mo exponer las inseguridades de los protas y c√≥mo las superan, teniendo para mi c√≥mo mensaje el confiar en los dem√°s y no dejar que nadie externo intente quebrar nuestra confianza con la otra persona, el c√≥mo la envidia se puede volver auto destructiva al estar obstinado con victimizarte por no tener la vida de X persona, aunque tal vez de cierta medida hayas sido t√∫ el principal responsable. Siento que, aunque por momentos el personaje de Christian se estanca, me gust√≥ mucho la evoluci√≥n de Anastasia en las 3 pel√≠culas. El montaje de esta pel√≠cula sigue siendo incre√≠ble, lo mejor de estas pel√≠culas est√° en la fotograf√≠a y aunque esta queda m√°s peque√±a en escala visual con las otras 2 es muy buena, sigue teniendo este toque de comercial de perfumes, pero con una iluminaci√≥n y una paleta de colores hermosa, con un dise√±o de producci√≥n c√≥mo en las otras 2 pel√≠culas espectacular, los lugares donde se desarrollan la trama, c√≥mo el departamento o la oficina de Anastasia son hermosos. La direcci√≥n es est√°ndar por momentos, pero nunca es aburrida, siempre se juega muy bien con la paleta de colores, y la m√∫sica de fondo ayuda a crear una sensaci√≥n realmente agradable. Donde, aunque por momentos el guion es algo impulsivo con las emociones de los personajes, funciona. 50 Sombras de Grey liberadas a pesar de caer en convencionalismos argumentales, la pel√≠cula logra ser entretenida, por momentos logra ser emp√°tica y en el 3 acto honestamente, aunque sea muy fuera de s√≠ en la trama el suspenso funciona.",0
0.5,"Oh yeah, I'd totally be okay with living in a house with a room that was filled with sex toys that had been used on 15 previous women by my beau. I might just go lock myself in the room and take a nap because it was so relaxing in there. And I'd be totally fine with him using those toys on me too. How delightful!... Come on! Do they really believe audiences are that dumb? If this was in the book, there's a reason movies deviate from the literary sources. It doesn't translate well to screen. Use that creative freedom when you can! The antagonist here is ridiculous. Maybe sounded beter in the book but I felt like I was watching a soap opera that has run out of plots because it's been on air for decades. Didn't buy his revenge plot. And my oh my was he sooooo capable. It was like taking Mission Impossible Tom Cruise and putting him in this movie. Able to leap bounds and defeat all systems. He was a book editor people NOT a highly trained CIA agent with mad skills. And sorry... Blackmail? Seriously? Um, if he showed the sex tapes of the women he'd be incrimitating himself for sleeping with all his employees. Not believable. I felt like this movie was trying to knock off Twilight but Grey is not Edward. Didn't buy he was so pained like Edward was. No chemistry. Not believable in plot or anything. No romance. She's not going to change this messed up f*cker with a smile and some boobs. Dude needs professional help. Just all around unwatchable and ridiculous.",-1

2.5,"You can't compare the second and third part with the first part. The first part was the best, it had the real Fifty shades of Grey story, the atmosphere, the real sex and the fear of the new. The second one was just romance and kitsch, even Christian wasn't himself anymore. But the third part is again another version of the destroyed Fifty Shades of Grey. At least they've noticed that the second part hadn't even got real BDSM sex scenes, so they've put more of them in the third part. Still it's not the same. Now that the whole story actually really has to end they're making of an erotic story, first a love story and in the third part an action movie, which doesn't even got real action. I think it's really stupid. In the second part Christian wanted to change himself, but in the third part he still is forbidding Anastasia to go out with Kate. It just seems like the first part was so succesfull, so they've made other parts which don't even make sense, just for money. Of course there are three parts of the books, but I didn't read the second and third part to say something about them. Still, it's ok to watch it as an experience, but at the end, it's just an continuation without sense.",-1
0.5,"Just when you start to think that things can't get much worse, along comes Fifty Shades Freed, the final chapter, hopefully, of the trilogy. This time around, Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) and Christian (Jamie Dornan) decide to marry and snuggle into a life of marital bliss, which lasts all of about five minutes. Faster than Anastasia can recite her safe word, problems arise ‚Äì he's as controlling as ever, she begins to stand up for herself, they bicker about having a child, and a figure from Jamie's past emerges to cause all sorts of unforeseen problems. The usual issues continue in this entry, namely horrible dialogue, a strong Hallmark look and feel, all kinds of characters who just don't matter, an annoying soundtrack and score, and a weird swing to thriller mode. Johnson does her best to salvage things, but this is by far the worst entry in the trilogy, which is saying something.",-1

5.0,"This series touched my heart in ways most people can never understand. Having grown up surrounded by violence and alcoholism I can relate to Christian Grey's character all too well. Especially once you learn about his background and fears of getting attached to anyone. His inability to differentiate violence from love was realistic and extremely sad. Also I love Dakota Johnsons sweet, innocent and gentle wittiness. She was cast perfectly for the role of Heroine. The couple was depicted night and day different yet complimented each other in every way. Aside from the unnecessary nudity I found their romance simply moving and beautiful. Im not ashamed to admit I cried like a Sap during the proposal scene in part 2. All in all it came together as the perfect love story with lots of extra cheese moments I fell for hook, line and sinker and perhaps a few added cable ties, Duck tape and Rope...The complete serial killer package =)",1
1.5,) The movie is pathetic picturisation of the novel. All 3 movie failed to do justice for the books. I have read all 6 books of grey Series. In movie the characters are failed to create christian insecurity or Ana deepest love for christian. If one who have not read the books will see the movie then for them it's kind of sex oriented movies. I am disappointed with movies,-1
1.0,"The only nice things I can say about ""Fifty Shades Freed"" are that it is maybe slightly better than the second one and that it is mercifully the shortest movie in the series as well as the last. At this point, I don't care at all about the characters, the fact that they're getting married (spoilers if you care?) is laughably baffling and promotes all of the wrong things. The movie is another bad dialogue-fueled snooze fest that is more of the same. I think maybe 20 minutes of this movie could be seen as somewhat entertaining but it's not nearly enough to save this disaster. Overall, this has to be one of the absolute worst movie series I have ever seen. It infuriates me that this book and movie series has a following, there are countless romance stories that deserve your time. Please only watch these movies if you plan on destroying them in some sort of online review like me, otherwise you'll find your time wasted by the time you get to the lackluster finale.",-1

Everything goes well until Anastasia's old boss Jack Hyde (Eric Johnson) starts stalking her and seeks revenge for getting fired in Fifty Shades Darker (2018). That's it I really don't need to go into this more. The movie has some terrible acting, a thin plot and some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard uttered from someone's mouth in a film. This movie's trash, it has nothing going for it. I'm obviously not the target audience here, but this movie was an hour and 50 minutes long and 45 minutes in I thought two hours had already gone by.

'Clumsy' is probably a good word for it - several key scenes were very heavy handed, most notably the one where they meet the architect for their new house. The movie is a billboard advertisement for the lifestyle of the 1%, as other reviews noted. It seemed like both of the actors had grown tired of their roles, especially with this and the last one filmed back to back, and that both did noticeably worse in this one compared to the one where they would've been fresher. The whole subplot about Christian's boyfriend cheating on his girlfriend literally went nowhere. There was nothing particularly BDSM about the majority of the sex scenes.

It's just two characters having sex and then the villain from the second film shows up in the third act.

1.0,"Only reason I give this 1 star and not 0,5 is because of nostalgia. I watched it and loved it when I was a kid. As I re watched this year I saw how horrible the writing and story is. All this movie is, is a money grabber and nothing else.",-1

4.5,"this film is so squeakin good, only thing id wish id seen is Theo getting his cheeks filled by Alvin.",1
5.0,"Honestly this entire franchise is so underrated like the tomato meter for this movie isn't deserved. When I watch these movies I'm never bored and the plot has something to do with each character's personality like Alvin wants his family to be respected even he doesn't show that very much, Simon is in love with Jannette and really wants to fit in but he's easy to be picked on, and Theodore is DEATHLY AFRAID OF EAGLES! He shows this fear due to Toby telling him his family would die if an eagle picked up the chipmunks accidentally scaring him. Theodore becomes obsessed with meerkats and thinks that he should live with meerkats due to him being body shamed and thinks he doesn't fit in. Brittany is a great character because she shows she cares about her sisters and believes no one should be a lead but all of them are lead singers but Ian doesn't approve and influences her to be a leader practically forcing her to be a lead singer. Overall this movie didn't deserve the ratings it got. Alvin the Chipmunks: the Squeakquel was not a hidden gem but a hidden diamond. I think that since this movie was made for kids critics didn't really pay attention to the movie and gave it a bad rating because it's Alvin and the Chipmunks. You can really see how hard people worked on this movie just for people to say it's bad and walk away.",1

I sorta remembering wanting an Alvin And The Chipmunks pirate movie called Alvin And The Chipmunks The Pirates, although that never happened, but we got this movie, Chipwrecked. I never saw these movies in a long time, like other people, i either seemed to like or hate this movie along with other Chipmunks flicks. I'm not saying i like nor hate any of these movies, but i feel like i should move on from Alvin And The Chipmunks. Not their Christmas song, i like it, but the films i should possibly move on from.

0.5,This movie takes the charm of the other three movies and puts it in the bin this movie takes the cringe factor level up to 11 and appeal to the lowest common denominator the critics were right about this movie they really need to do some rewrites with this story because the road chip told this story in a way better way,-1

5.0,"This was honestly one of the best movies that I have seen in a LONG time. It was a truly ""laugh out loud"" comedy with humor for all ages. I was inspired by main character, Ian Hawke, to be myself and never give up on my dreams. Don't even get me started on the costume designers for this movie. They were absolutely FABULOUS. My favorite piece was Ian's majestic bird costume. I am truly thankful to the writers of this film because before this franchise, I honestly had lost all hope for Hollywood. Alvin brings so much character to the big screen, Simon brings the brains, and Theodore brings great representation to all overweight chipmunks.",1

0.5,"I actually used to unironically like these movies back when I was an idiot with no taste. I laughed at them and not sarcastically or out of pity. Even back in 2011, part of me felt that it wasn't as entertaining as the last two. Guess a juvenile parody of Cast Away wasn't trendy with the kids. Lowest common denominator fare that's one of the laziest films I've ever seen that couldn't be more blatantly screaming ""Money, dear boy"" if it had Laurence Olivier (or rather, a CGI likeness of him which is most definitely not a reference to a movie released in 2004 that did the CGI resurrection thing years before Star Wars did it) in it.

5.0,i really liked this one its fun,1
3.0,"The story for this movie seemed a bit ""Made for TV-ish"" but at least the filmmakers finally gave the chipmunks more songs to sing.

3.5,"Although ""Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked"" was pretty unrealistic, it relates a lot to real life by distributing some wonderful messages throughout the fantastic plot. All of the characters were unique, and it was very well directed by Mike Mitchell. It was also brilliantly written by Glenn Berger & Jonathan Aibel. As with all the previous movies, the performances really need to improve. I also hate when Jason Lee (Dave) yells. It sounds really cheesy. I don't think this sequel was as good as the first movie (Mainly because it was a bit boring), but it was ok. After all, it did end with a pretty catchy song!

0.5,"18/100 - I don't know how these films keep getting made. The first Alvin and the Chipmunks movie was bad enough. The sequel was a disaster. This is no better. Juvenile comedy, juvenile characters, and juvenile production values all come to a head here. Anyone who has their kid asking them to see this should direct them towards literally anything outside of this franchise because it would be leagues better. I regret putting my time into this, a third installment of a franchise that shouldn't have had a second.",-1
2.0,This just a slight improvement over the Squeakquel but in away thats just like saying one turd smells better than another. I saw movie in theaters on my 11th birthday and even back then I didn't it was that good and this would have been my first stage of my becoming a critic in not only movie but in entertainment in general so I at least have to thank this movie helping me become the who I am today.,-1
0.5,Time for hunting season,-1
2.5,"Attempting to reinvigorate this classic character for a modern audience, Yogi Bear sets out to create a fun kids movie. While the plot is basic, you will constantly be entertained and it is thoroughly enjoyable to watch . The charm of this comes heavily from the wonderful cast, with Ranger Smith (Tom Cavanagh) and Yogi (Dan Aykroyd) stand out as a delightful pairing. Unfortunately, the green screening is abysmal at points and fully ruins one of the biggest sequences in the film, going from engaging to laughable. While other films have done similar stories better, Yogi Bear has quite a bit of charisma and it's hard to be disappointed at a film that stays so true to the classic characters.",-1
5.0,such a good movie!!!,1
5.0,DAVID: This is so goood,1
5.0,"I love it . Yogi ‚Äòs voice actor nailed it , Boo-Boo and Justin Timberlake were a surprising combination that really worked. It made me wanna watch the show! The plot was PERFECT! I wanted to visit Jellystone park and give Yogi and Boo-Boo my picnic basket! Also, Ranger Smith is SO ATTRACTIVE! Please watch this movie, it's funny, it's got heart, the CGI is fantastic! It's easy to slam a movie like ""Yogi Bear""- just talk about how simplistic the script written by no less than three writers; or how childish the antics are of the titular character and his cautious sidekick, Boo-Boo; or even how repetitive pic-a-nic basket stealing gets. Yes, they are all fair observations of this live-action adaptation of the 1960s Hanna-Barbera cartoon, but I wouldn't go so far as to criticise the movie for these very traits. If you've seen the Saturday morning cartoons, you'll find that this film actually stays extremely faithful to its source. In them, Yogi goes around doing perhaps one thing and one thing only- that's right, stealing pic-a-nic baskets and thinking to himself how he's ""smarter than the average bear""- together with Boo-Boo, occasionally running into Jellystone National Park's head ranger Smith who yells at him for disturbing the peace. We used to laugh at Yogi's foolish schemes (or at least I remember I did), so why is it so difficult to laugh at the same things all over again? Sure many of us who have enjoyed those cartoons may have grown up, but that's not a fault of the film, especially when those in the audience who were of the age when we were watching the cartoons were obviously having a great time. Around the regular pic-a-nic stealing, writers Jeffrey Ventimilia, Joshua Sternin and Brad Copeland have spun an eco-friendly story of the unscrupulous town mayor (Andrew Daly) who aims to sell off Jellystone to the loggers to cover the city's deficit. Needless to say, it will be up to Ranger Smith, his love interest the nature documentarian Rachel (Anna Faris), and of course Yogi and Boo-Boo to save the day. Yes it's simple but the plot is just serviceable enough to be the glue this live-action treatment needs. Ultimately, the stars of the show were always Yogi and Boo-Boo, and in this regard, both the voice actors and the animators have done a wonderful job. Dan Aykroyd does his best Daws Butler impersonation for Yogi Bear, most impressive for nailing his character's distinctive speech patterns. Just as outstanding is Justin Timberlake, clearly relishing the opportunity to disappear into the role of Boo-Boo, complete with the trademark nasal delivery. It's especially interesting to think how Timberlake sounds so uncannily like the classic Don Messick. Director Eric Brevig (of 2008's ""Journey to the Centre of the Earth"") keeps the gags flying fast and furious, so even if some of the supposed verbal punchlines fall flat, there is always something visually appealing to hold your attention. An Oscar-nominated effects specialist, Brevig makes great use of the stereoscopy to deliver all sorts of visual gimmicks- whether something flying in your face or hurling you along- but it adds nicely to the fun. I rate it 5 stars",1
0.5,"An absolutely hideous jumble of careless acting, cheaply stupid gags, and unconvincing special effects, this is a movie only children could possibly enjoy.",-1
2.0,"With actors that look embarrassed to be involved in such a worthless project and 3D effects that look more like something out of a Yogi Bear video game than a big-screen Hollywood film, this poor, depthless adaption of a once-beloved cartoon is brainless and unfunny.",-1
5.0,"This movie is FUN! Our whole family enjoys this film. We have watched this many times because it is funny and enjoyable even without the 3D effects. The low rotten tomatoes rating is a huge shock to us, that's why I added my review and vote because this film deserves to be recognized as an excellent piece of entertainment. Your family will enjoy it.",1
2.0,"It's bad other than Justin Timberlake nailing the voice of Boo Boo Bear. However, It's got a few laughs and it doesn't offend the regular fans too much. But if you're looking for an more faithful version with complex plot and good acting, find an another adaption.",-1

5.0,"peak cinema, great for all the family after Sharon left and took one child",1
2.5,This shouldn't have been a theater release. This is a direct to TV release. The acting is not good with no chemistry at all and one dimensional characters. The cinematography is not good either. You never once feel like Yogi is actually there with the humans and its just a bunch of cheap green screen shots half the time. It's such a waster opportunity with the park serving as a lavish setting. The camerawork is extremely basic and uninspired. The music is just a bunch of out of place dated pop songs. The editing and pacing is ok honestly because it only is 80 minutes long. The plot is extremely basic and some of the jokes did get a chuckle but most I laughed at for how bad they were. This isn't the worst thing ever and nothing is truly broken about it but everything feels very subpar. Skip This. Your Kids deserve better like Moana.,-1

2.0,"I'm not sure what to even make of this. Someone at Warner Bros was super excited about making ""Yogi Bear"" the movie after Hanna Barbara was acquired and finally got their shot. It feels like they didn't put much thought into what it should be. As a fan (when I was a kid) of Yogi Bear, the nostalgic feel wasn't there, and the movie does a really odd thing: it over saturates Yogi in the beginning (you know, so you'll remember this is a Yogi Bear movie), but then starts another movie where it becomes very clear it's not about Yogi. The actually premise of this story seems to be Ranger Reverse Flash trying to get with Anna Fairs, while Yogi and Boo Boo hang around, causing mischief. This all while a 3rd story is happening where the incompetent Mayor (long story short) is trying to destroy Jellystone Park. There is something to be said for multiple storylines working amazingly well in movies, however, this is almost a textbook example of how to do it mechanically well, but hardly being compelling. That and the idea that this is a Yogi Bear movie is like saying that Mallrats was a Jay and Silent Bob movie: they characters are there, they're even critical to the main plot, but it's not ABOUT them. In the end this is a odd mix of great writing fundamentals and lacking character investment is just lacking. Barely a watchable movie, do so if you feel the urge, but you, and I, won't be missing anything if we don't.",-1

5.0,"I'd honestly put this at four and a half stars, but I gave it the five since it's received so little love. I saw it in 2D, and it successfully brought back every memory of Yogi and Boo Boo that I remembered. Dan Akroyd and JT did an amazingly good job with the voices, and I liked the animation - too often the CGI stuff just moves too much - this has a nice classic retro feel, but updated. The plot was pretty straightforward, and I loved the Joe Flynn vibe of the mayor, and the similar caricature bad guy assistant. It pushed all the classic kid movie buttons for me, all the way down to the slapstick humor and the inane, silly, and enjoyable plot. It's predictable, but it still has a few surprises, and it's lots of fun. It's worth 82 minutes, and Tom Cavanagh and Anna Faris turn in earnest and surprisingly believable performances in the leads, interacting with a talking bear, and T.J.Miller and Nathan Corrdry are great in their supporting roles. It's fun, not art, not meant to move you, but it's got laughs and a good heart. Worth a look.",1
1.0,"Ah, that phase from the late 2000s to the early 2010s where Hollywood made live-action/CGI hybrid comedy films set in the 21st century focusing on your childhood cartoon characters that all had the same visual effects studio involved and having already gone out of style by the time the fourth Alvin and the Chipmunks movie came out. There was once a time when I used to like these. Nowadays, I have more refined taste. At least, I like to think so. Yogi Bear's not good. That's all I can say about it. The animation is fine and the voice acting is not too shabby but this is just yet another combination of a cheap cash-in and a generic live-action/CGI kids' movie that stuffs more ham-fisted environmental messages down your throat than you can shake a stick at...and that stick has the DVD or Blu-ray disc of James Cameron's Avatar, itself not exactly subtle at pro-environmentalism. As mentioned before, good thing Hollywood mostly moved on from these by the time, Alvin and the Chipmunks 4 came out.",-1

It's ok to be a dumb kids movie that you have to be 9 or under to enjoy, but this is off a beloved cartoon that could have had a good movie. Older people were probably watching this hoping it would be a great throwback to there childhoods but it seems to fall into the same category of cartoons turned into a bad live action/GC hybrid film. And don't expect good animation on Yogi and Boo Boo, they look like the animators just wanted a pay day and made them to cartoony looking. Two words, MOTION CAPTURE!!!!!!!! And the plot, actors, and a lot of other things in this movie aren't good either. Young kids may enjoy this, but anyone over 10 should probably just watch something else.

1.5,Cash grab and painful to watch. Makes you wonder why the franchise went this direction?,-1
2.0,"A great franchise made into a cash grab. It sickens me. Transformers The Last Knight is an atrocity at every angle. From the characters to the sheer absurdity that is the plot, this is honestly the lowest point of an action movie. Let's start with the story. Picking up a good bit after age of extinction, we start further into the past. A medieval battle where Camelot is falling, Merlin goes to seek help from the 12 guardian knights. They agree to help and turn the tide of battle. Picking up hundreds of years later, a few kids decide to go find some dead transformers, they nearly get caught by the government, and are saved by girl who has a ridiculous amount of screen time and little to no value towards anything related to the plot. Her autobot companion dies, resulting in one of the few times I felt anything other than boredom and confusion in the entirety of the movie, kids are saved by Cade Yeager who is the ""main protagonist"", Cade nearly gets caught by the government and bee splits into X amount of parts and pieces himself back together. They put a tracker on bee and we get even more reasons to not like the movie. The girl is just pouring her heart out and we really don't care. Optimus lands on Cybertron and meets Quintessa and Infernicus. We learn earth is Unicron and Cybertron can heal itself at the cost of earth. Horns sprout out of the ground, and we get megatron and the talisman. Which bonds with Cade and has some significance. Megatron gets a crew of decepticons and ambushes Cade. The good guys run and Grimlock is treated like a guard dog. Fight fight fight. And this rich guy played by Anthony Hopkins has a butler go and find Cade. The only amusing part of the story. Cade gets on a plane, goes to the uk, and learns that bee has a history in world war 2, meets a hot lady, hot lady doesn't believe in myths, and gets kidnapped also. Hot lady decends from Merlin, she is the key to the ""staff"" ,which we're only learning about now, goes under the ocean, followed by government, nearly gets killed by a dead transformer, nearly gets killed by Optimus, bee nearly dies by Optimus but cliche to the rescue, he learns to talk on his own! There was a 10 minute segment devoted to the fact that Bee cannot talk and trying to get him to talk again. Optimus nearly dies by the guardian knights, Cade is revealed to be the 13th knight, inspirational Optimus speech, 10 minute action segments made useless by the fact that the plan fails, Cade and lady try and do it themselves, Optimus helps, megatron gets kicked out of the sky, Quintessa dies, the rest of megatons crew dies, they flee Cybertron, and alls well that ends well. It's flawed. Boring, and a 3 hour waste of time. And the fact that this is the last time that Michal Bay directs one of these things is a massive relief.",-1
1.0,"When I finished this movie. I stared at the empty tv. And sighed. It was a sigh of pain, and exhaustion. The Micheal transformers franchise started on fire. And then the fire just died. This movie isn't so bad it's good. It's just so bad. And that's all I'll say about this movie.",-1

4.0,"Really Enjoyable! Vivian is so Gorgeous. Mark Walbherg with his over the top acting is good as usual and the CGI is amazing. the fight choreography is amazing even though it was short-lived, Nemesis Prime was Cool and the Design. My Only Gripe with this movie is that the King Arthur/Merlin Stuff I Don't really care about and Quintessa u don't even care for. Also the mid credits scene didn't really make sense as it obviously led to nothing. Anthony Hopkins' Character's Death was so funny! Overall this movie is so underrated and overhated.",1

5.0,"Hello! I'd like to review this movie. I loved it very much because of some scenes such as when they introduced the character such as Onslaught (who needs a bigger door). Another thing I absolutely loved was the fact that Bumblebee somehow so randomly got his voice back and that made Optimus Prime not violently epicly awesomenessly murder Bumblebee into shreds. I also love the scene where Dreadbot said ""I am dreadbot""!!!!!!!!",1
2.0,"Pretty Awful, do not recommend.üíÄüò¨",-1
0.5,"I felt so disconnected with this movie. The movie itself felt this way and I felt detached watching it. Having not seen the previous films for a while, maybe that was part of it. But I felt like I was dumped in an already started film and it also left with an open ended finale. And what I saw just felt like a waste of time even thought monumental things were happening to the world. I didn't like how the scenes jumped around in a disconnected, unfinished way. There was a lot of backstory of ancient history with the Transformers on Earth that was just a bunch rushed exposition. It didn't feel like there was that much connection with the Autobots and the human characters this time around. One character was introduced then pretty much out of the picture for a large chunk. (Which was fine with me because I wasn't that excited about her, it was just strange.) I will say that what I did like was that the fighting scenes of the robots were pretty clear. None of this shaky cam where you can't even tell what you're looking at. There was some cool slow motion shots with that. Strangely enough the moment in the film that I enjoyed the most was seeing Optimus and Bee driving out of disaster in truck/car form. Anyway I just didn't enjoy this one.",-1
2.5,"the worst transformers movie ever, i am an hardcore transformers fan but this is a nightmare to watch, it doesn't feel like a transformers movie most of the time and the villain is horrible, the only good things were the nemesis prime and bumblebee battle, every scene where megatron is in",-1
2.5,"I went in the film thinking that Michael Bay was gonna go out with a bang instead barely nobody was in the theatre.

2.5,I have a soft spot for the transformers films and a love for Mark Wahlberg so this was already going to get a decent rating from me but the LENGTH of all these films is WAY too long. Some else said it best. This and the other films are just long trailers. I think if you like the others you'd like this but don't bother if you don't like the others,-1
2.5,Well annoying characters are back but the action was fair but definitely far from perfect,-1
2.5,"Honestly the worst installment in the series. Sadly, even the good stuff in it doesn't make it up for me unlike Revenge of the Fallen or Age of Extinction. And a sad shame cause it leaves so many unanswered questions that will never get solved since this killed the Bayverse. But after a rewatch a month or two ago, it's a so bad it's good movie in my eyes, so I had some enjoyment watching it. Pros -Like the previous films, amazing VFX -Transformers are still awesome, including new ones like Cogman, Hot Rod and Dragonstorm, as well as the returning ones such as the main AOE group, Megatron and Barricade. -Sound design is great -Nemesis Prime is a very threatening character -Some humor is a bit funny -Return of some recognizable characters from the previous films, most notably Lennox -The final battle and Nemesis Prime vs Bumblebee are pretty good. -Music is great CONS: -Very messy story and plot, with a lot of stuff not making sense and becoming very confusing. -Very shaky camera work and the aspect ratio changes too much. -I don't mind Micheal Bay reusing scenes, but during the submarine scene, they crash and reuse the scene where Megatron crashes into a sub after reviving in ROTF, which they didn't even bother to edit it out, it made me laugh so hard. -Various unnecessary scenes that weren't really needed -Humor is hit or miss -Not much good action packed scenes compared to the previous films. -Quintessa was a‚Ä¶ okay villain, also a part of me wished Nemesis Prime was a separate Transformer rather than mind controlled Optimus -Left lots of questions that will never get resolved (ex: how did Galvatron become Megatron again? Sam Witwicky's fate. And Unicron is still around, what will hapoen then?) -The movie marked the end of the Bayverse, which can be upsetting to some since DOTM could have been the end, or the fact we won't get a definitive ending of the franchise.",-1

2.5,"I can't even stop thinking about the time I was in a theater with two little kids barely anyone was in there. Bumblebee had a sold out showing when I seen it and Rise of the Beasts had enough people in the theater. While watching, the enjoyment from the first four was no longer there.",-1
0.5,"Thats it. Bayformer movies are over. We had the most satisfying ending in Dark of the Moon until one funded movie ruined it all. We have moved on.

2.0,"This movie completely destroys and blows up the foundation that Michael Bay laid when he made the first Transformers live action movie, the story of the all the previous moves goes out the window, this film feels like more of a standalone movie rather than a continuation of the Transformers live action movie line, with it's eye straining cuts from 16:9 ratio to full screen for what feels like every 10 seconds, this movie is what I would like to call Bay's playground, due to him basically not caring for the story and throwing Transformer characters into the movie, Transformers: The Last Knight a movie just to past the time and nothing else, I feel sorry for the entire team that worked on this movie, for all their hard work and talent to be wasted on a movie that drove the live action Transformers movie line into the dirt",-1

Even if I were to ignore that this is a Transformers movie, it's still bad by movie standards. Main characters we're very unlikeable and poorly written. The plot also doesn't make any sense. Apparently transformers fought in various wars in history and this was all covered up by the Witwikies family. One of the worst movies I've ever seen.",-1

1.5,"Ok. This movie makes Age of Extinction a Masterpiece. There are more Subplots than plot holes, and there are a LOT. Galvatron is somehow Megatron, what happened to the AllSpark, How is Earth Unicron with out anyone noticing, Quintessa is the creator? I thought they were made of flesh and multiple. what happened to Cybertron's size? It was 4x larger than earth and now it is 1/4 the size. Oh, and now Optimus is evil. Oh actually, bumblebee's voice turns him good again. Optimus said he hadn't heard it since the war. BUT HE HEARD HIM IN THE FIRST MOVIE! I feel like no one on the production team remembered that. Oh well the last 30 minutes is actually pretty good. not worth watching though",-1
2.5,The only reason I think this movie is mid but I only liked the bumblebee vs Nemesis prime fight really hit the heart strings to me cause he was having to fight us leader and his friend and the final battle was ok it wasn't the best fight act of the film but this movie isn't really that good I'd give it a solid 3/10 I only liked the fight scenes,-1

There are interesting plot points, but this monstrosity was all over the place. When you think you're just about getting the rhythm of the storytelling, another sideshow opens up and calls your attention to try to understand what's going on. It was a weird experience and the magic of watching a cartoon to live action movie seemed like it was purposely replaced by a gattling gun of experiments on how to tell a transformers story. You will not be able to breathe to form an opinion on how the story's going, it will mentally shove you to keep on going forward.",-1

Anthony Hopkins was a fantastic addition to the cast, as he always is to any film. The fact that Optimus Prime appeared in the film for less than five minutes and played the antagonist for even less time raises my only two concerns. Optimus was supposed to be the villain in this movie, but he didn't do much to merit the hype. Additionally, the entire King Arthur story didn't appear to match the mould for this genre.

The effects look good, but everything else manages to bring this movie down. If you are a fan of the previous Transformers movies, you should probably skip this movie. If you are a fan of Transformers, you should really evade this movie like your life depends on it.

1.5,"After the disappointment that Age of Extinction was, my hopes from this franchise had fallen to zero. However, I still had one ray of hope - it couldn't be worse than that, right? The story is already bad, the characters are no longer interesting, the continuity doesn't matter anymore, and hey, just one more movie is left after which I'll get to watch the super-awesome Bumblebee, so let's just tolerate one more movie. And boy, was I wrong when I didn't take one more factor into account: At least the cinematography was good in all the previous movies. Here even that fails. The most distracting thing in this entire movie is the continuously changing aspect ratio. There's a very important rule in filmmaking, that your jump cuts should be so seamless that the audience shouldn't realise when the jump cut takes place. Look at Marvel movies. When Black Widow fights there are like a gazillion jump cuts in just one somersault. If that is supposed to be silently moving across the room, the jump cuts of The Last Knight are like dragging an almirah across the room hoping no one would notice. You can literally see the jump cuts happen! And speaking of jump cuts ruining the mood, whenever the jump cuts happen in the same scene it feels like it is a completely different scene. Like in the scene where they are in the elevator and they see the butler bot over there, it feels as if the scene outside the elevator is a completely different place. The lighting is also so bad, it doesn't even feel like there's continuity until the jump cut happens again and the camera goes back to Cade and company. Apart from that there is also a scene where Cade stops his car in front of the sheriff and when he's stopping the car there's a lot of dust. But when the jump cut happens the dust is all gone. And while he's still stopping his car his voice starts coming. Like, he isn't even moving his mouth and the words are coming out louder than the car's engine. Another time the ADR ruins the mood is when the butler bot is playing the piano when the story of the Transformers is being narrated. He is asked to stop playing... Twice! A bad joke is repeated twice in just fifteen seconds! Then of course there's the fight between Optimus Prime and Bumblebee, the legendary fight for which everyone came to watch it. Because the movie had been advertised by saying that Optimus Prime is the bad guy in this movie. And guess how their fight ends? Martha! No, not by saying those exact words, but something similar. Just as Optimus is about to stab Bumblebee, he says, ""I'm Bumblebee. I'll lay my life before you!"" And that changes Optimus Prime's mood. First of all, why did it change his mood? He's a robot not a human. Emotions can't alter his programming. And secondly how on earth did Bumblebee suddenly start speaking? It's not like his voice suddenly fixed. It was permanently damaged. It's kinda weird that in this movie the humans are not the bad part. In fact I really liked its starting, where they were showing Merlin take help from the dragon Transformer to win the battle. I also liked how those kids were collecting spare parts to survive. Even showing Optimus Prime on his planet looked so cool. The way it began I was really wondering why on earth this movie has such bad reviews. If the movie focused on either of the two things it could have been a great movie. I really wanted to like it, but the jump cuts were making me laugh even on the serious scenes. I'm sorry, Michael Bay. But I think you've ruined a good movie by hiring a bad cinematographer.",-1

Excessively long runtime Little character development Embarrassingly pointless humor You could watch this movie over and over again and still be able to point out all of the flaws. It's that kind of movie that would make you refuse to eat your popcorn even whilst watching it the first time over.

As buddy cop movies go, they're supposed to make us laugh rahter than make us annoyed. Kevin Hart's cahracter is supposed to annoy Ice Cube's character, not the audience.",-1

2.0,"SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, it looks like Kevin Hart wants to go along for the ride. Shall we review? GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) I don t have the heart to say no. Let s recap. SCOTT: We meet Ben Barber (Kevin Hart), who works as a security guard at a local school but aspires to become a member of the Atlanta Police Department. Ben is dating a woman named Angela (Tika Sumpter) who is the sister of a current APD officer named James (Ice Cube). No matter how hard he tries, Ben can t seem to impress James, who doesn t believe that Ben is worthy of dating his sister. GREG: Through a series of awkward events, James challenges Ben to go on a ride along with him in his police car. James offers that if Ben can keep up with him for a full day then he can have his blessing for his sister s hand in marriage. But James stacks the odds against Ben by taking on only the most annoying calls and Ben quickly becomes frustrated. SCOTT: Greg, Ride Along is a sort-of buddy cop story involving a funny guy, Ben, and a straight man, James. One has to be a Kevin Hart fan to enjoy this movie, and while I don t claim to be his biggest fan, I did appreciate his talent and some of his antics. Hart and Ice Cube are a modern-day Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin; there is nonstop zaniness from Hart followed by scowls of disapproval by James. Both characters are likeable and I found myself rooting for them to achieve detente. GREG: As we ve seen with other buddy films, the buddies usually start out as adversaries and gradually grow to find a center. This was true of last year s The Heat with Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy. In Ride Along, we see scene after scene of straight man James introducing Ben to situations he is not able to handle. But, James has a knack for noticing small details that eventually become useful to him. As the story progresses, we find that James is tracking bad guy Omar (Laurence Fishburne) whom no one has seen. This shadowy figure controls the local drug and gun black market. This becomes the main object of the pair s attention. SCOTT: Indeed. It s a predictable plot and so the appeal of the movie centers on whether you enjoy Kevin Hart s physical comedy and verbally explosive humor. I do give this movie credit for creating two heroes whose characters evolve nicely as a result of their experiences. Ben is given the opportunity to show a crafty courageousness that enables him to win the approval of James. And as for James, he realizes that he has to let his sister live her own life, and he must also swallow his pride by admitting that his negative assessment of Ben was wrong. As you point out, Greg, this bonding of two cops who initially dislike each other is typical of many buddy cop movies. And so the key here is in the performances and in the execution of the various predictable plot elements. Ride Along does a decent job along these lines but it s all pretty standard fare. GREG: You re not kidding when you say this was predictable, Scott. There is the classic ornery boss who wants James not to follow his instincts. There is the go-to snitch on the street. There s the rotten cop on the take. All the elements of the classic buddy-cop movie are here. The villain was a disappointment. Omar is never seen until the last few scenes of the movie. He is built up as a dastardly dude who controls others from afar. Inexplicably, he shows up at a gun deal and shows how awful he is by killing one of his henchmen, because, you know, he s mean. There is no dimension to this character and zero backstory. He s just a bad, bad, man. Not a very interesting villain. SCOTT: You re right, Greg. The villain in this story, Omar, is mostly a figurehead who is spoken of ominously throughout the movie. When he does make an appearance at the end, he proves himself to be capably evil but hardly memorable. I was thinking that the only way to salvage my interest in the villain would be to make Kevin Hart, who pretends to be Omar, to turn out to be the actual Omar. But that would have been problematic for other reasons, and so we re largely left with a vacuous villain. GREG: Ride Along is a plodding device for Kevin Hart s humor, like him or not. It borrows from all the buddy-cop movies that came before it and offers nothing new. There was scarcely a joke or giggle for the first 30 minutes and that was a deadly silence to bear. I can only give Ride Along 2 Reels out of 5. Our buddy-heroes were pretty dull - not funny and not interesting. They both did converge into a sense of mutual admiration if not acceptance. I give them 2 Heroes out of 5. The villain was nearly non-existent and only served to pull a Snidely Whiplash and abduct the damsel in distress (James s sister) at the very end of the film. For a lackluster and generically bland villain I give Omar just 1 Villain out of 5. Movie: Heroes: Villains: SCOTT: As you noted while we walked out of the theater, Greg, I did chuckle twice during this movie. I therefore give Ride Along one reel for each chuckle for a total of 2 Reels out of 5. This film avoids receiving the dreaded 1 Reel because Kevin Hart is a good talent, and because Ice Cube deserves credit for handling Hart s goofiness with noble restraint. Our two heroes do undergo a transformation during the course of events in this movie. The hero story is hardly inspiring but it does contain some rudimentary elements of the hero s journey. For that reason, I ll generously award our dynamic duo a total of 3 Heroes out of 5. As you point out, the villain was as flimsy as a piece of cardboard. He exists in name only and virtually no effort was made to render him the least bit interesting. So like you, Greg, I can only hand out a measly 1 Villain out of 5. Movie: Heroes: Villains:",-1

Whether it was the funny back and forth between Ice Cube's and Kevin Hart's characters or the suspenseful engagements between them and the ""bad guys"", they had me hooked to my television and hanging on their every word. I found myself laughing uncontrollably and even rewinding my DVR to replay some of they're hilarious banter. All in all, this was not my favorite movie or even genre, but still it was great entertainment and if given the chance I'd watch it a few times more...at least.

2.0,"Kevin Hart once again shows why he's one of the most loved comedians on the planet, but it's not enough to carry a movie that's better left for TV. Kevin Hart plays Ben, a man with a low level job and an energetic, yet weaker figure. His girlfriend just so happens to be a cop, who happens to dislike Ben a lot. In order to get her brother's blessing to marry her, Ben goes on a ride along with James. Little does he know that the job may have more in store than what he was expecting. Now, let me tell you the one and only good thing about this movie. Kevin Hart is one of the funniest dudes that I've ever seen and at this moment, I'm not tired of him yet. His energy, his personality, his child-like mannerism, his facial expressions, his emotions, his voice, his stature, his comedic timing, it's all perfect. Hart is truly one of the best comedians I know and he hasn't failed to make me laugh. I laughed plenty of times during this movie, solely because of him. He basically carries this movie and takes a screenplay that has nothing going for it, and gives us a reason to at least give this film a chance. Some people don't like Kevin Hart, but he's one of the best comedians I know. As for the rest of this movie, well, yeah, you know. This movie doesn't really have much going for it. It's the most basic, generic, and not so interesting buddy cop movie that I've ever seen. Literally, if Kevin Hart wasn't in this, it would probably be a terrible film. The screenplay was so generic and ill paced that it was almost laughable. The dialogue wasn't necessarily smart, it was just the add-lip and improvisation from Hart that made it decent. There's nothing special about the story and I for sure won't remember what this movie is about. On terms of buddy-cop films, I actually like the combination of Ice Cube and Kevin Hart. These two work really well together and their opposite physiques and personalities help them compliment each other. Now Cube isn't as funny as Hart, but they both manage to build off each other to make them an enjoyable pair. The movie tried to go a bit deeper with its plot and its character development, but it wasn't done very well. The lack of character development really shines in this movie and although there was an attempt, their execution was poor. Not only did I not really care about the characters, but I didn't learn anything that I couldn't have learned from this film's Wikipedia page. By the way, during the finale, when Hart was all up in the warehouse leveling out his monologues, I thought that scene went on for way too long. It brought the finale to a huge halt and got you so disconnected from the film that you couldn't wait for it to end. Then the movie went on for about 20 more unnecessary minutes that I didn't care about. Look, there's nothing good about this film, really. But if you want to pop in a mindless, stupid comedy in the background and you love Kevin Hart, I would say go for it. I own this movie simply for the occasion where I need to watch something so stupid that I can put this in. A simple review for a simple movie.",-1

3.0,Ok movie. The casting was pretty good but the story lacked depth.,0
2.5,"Mostly mindless fun, but it's running time is a little too long for a silly comedy. The leads are good, Cube the typical angry straight man, as he excels at, and Hart funny as the sidekick who freaks out, which are the best laugh out loud parts of the movie. Watched on Netflix at Sam's house with her, July 2, 2016.",-1
5.0,Great and funny movie,1

3.0,Decently funny. Ice Cube & Hart have some great chemistry.,0
4.0,"Kevin Hart es el alma de esta pelicula, los momentos comicos son muchos y de gran manera. Un final predecible pero igual divertido",1
1.5,"If Kevin Hart was any less funny, he'd be hosting The Daily Show. The script is bad, the acting is worse, the jokes are basically non existent. It feels like all the stuff left on the Bad Boys cutting room floor was rehashed to put this together... Probably best to Ride Along... Resonant Line: ""James Payton: Oh, yeah, you're ready for the streets. Ben Barber: This gun should be banned.""",-1
2.0,"It¬¥s boring and lack of humor, plus its 99 minutes are endless.",-1
2.0,Generic buddy cop movie...,-1
3.0,"You have got to give the world's funniest man alive award to Kevin Hart playing Ben, a security guard, in Ride Along. In this action, comedy film, Ben, a short motor-mouth, joins his girlfriend's brother, James (Ice Cube), a short-tempered cop, to prove to him that he is worthy to marry his sister, Angela (Tika Sumpter); but here is the catch, the only thing that Ben knows about being a detective is from video games like Call of Duty. ""You've got one day and one day only to show me what you got,"" James tells him. Ultimately, the plot gets twisted when Ben thinks the case is not real, so he did not take anything of it seriously which adds a turn to the movie. Within one hour and thirty-nine minutes, Ben manages to gives the movie a boost of energy mixed with the determined attitude of James that balances out each other. Imagine Rush Hour with Hart playing as Ronnie Shields in Role Models; that pretty much sums up the entire movie in your head. The director, Tim Story, who also directed Ice Cube in Barbershop and Hart in Think Like A Man, knows his characters strengths and weaknesses. One of Hart's greatest advantages is his nonstop loudmouth, and Mr. Story gave him plenty of opportunities to use his assets in a humorous way. This PG-13 movie targets an audience of younger adults due to Hart's stand-up comedy. If this story was to be lowered down to just story, relationship, or logic, then it would not be half as good, but for Hart, the fewer plots, the better. He does his own thing as a standup comedian and builds his own story which makes this movie funny. This is a clich√© cop movie having a short, funny character with a tall, tough character not liking each other, but slowly bonding as they go after a major mob boss; this is how the movie got the name Ride Along. There is not a moment of surprise in some scenes. The second Ben picks up a shotgun at a shooting range, for example, you know the kick will blast him to the back wall and you know James will react with a groan. Overall, Ride Along is a tremendous movie. Hart displays something else in his personality other than humor. He seems to be a sensitive and affectionate person; the presence of this quality gives body by adding a sentimental factor. On the other hand, Ice Cube reminds us of a fine, dramatic character just like Dwayne Johnson playing Hobbs in Fast and Furious 6. The comedy and self-awareness is truly what makes this movie worth watching.",0
5.0,"They were hilarious. Plot line wasn't that great, not all that serious or realistic, but I've watched this twice and laughed like crazy both times.",1
4.0,Kevin Hart is funny and a like anything he is in it's good...maybe not the best but always fun...this one is no exception and with Ice Cube playing the bad ass brother to his GF...its the perfect combo...now to watch the second one!,1

1.5,"Ride Along podr√≠a haber sido una buddy movie graciosa y entretenida, contando con dos actores que han demostrado tener talento para la comedia como son Ice Cube y el c√≥mico Kevin Hart. No es el caso. Su trama es estupida y tipica, los personajes son un monton de estereotipos en muchos casos bastante ofensivos (si quieres dejar que te ofendan), su machismo impl√≠cito es horrible y descarado, no destaca en nada a nivel visual y lo peor de todo...no tiene gracia. Podr√°s soltar una carcajada en alg√∫n momento s√≠, pero por l√≠neas generales es una pel√≠cula tremendamente aburrida.",-1
5.0,Very funny Kevin Hart-Ice Cube comedy!!!,1
3.5,"Ride Along is a really good movie that the comedy saved it from being more of a bland cliched buddy cop movie. Ice Cube is good even though he's playing the same anger cop character as he did in 21 and 22 Jump Street. Kevin Hart is the best, and funniest, part of the film and is keep me of the saving point of it. The cop on pre-cop chemistry between Ice Cube and Kevin Hart is pretty good and can be funny at times. The plot is your everyday buddy cop movie that pulls no new surprises here. The characters are one-note and are just the usual type of characters that you see in a genre like this. Ride Along is a funny movie that a story like this has been done before, wouldn't be much of a bother if there are really good jokes, which there are in this one.",0
4.0,"Good combination of Ice Cube and Kevin Hart, looking forward to the 2nd film hoping it doesn't ruin the franchise.",1
4.0,Well done! Funny throughout the entire film!!! But there were some scenes that I will always remember!!! A solid 4 stars is the most reasonable rating for this movie.,1
1.0,"I was drawn to this because I saw the trailer for the sequel and an interview with the stars and the sequel looked quite funny. However, it seems I was fooled. A strictly formulaic buddy movie, pretty tedious, Ice Cube plays his usual grumpy self and Kevin Hart's attempts to liven things up with his goofiness just come across as annoying, whereas in the right role he can be quite funny. Will be avoiding the sequel.",-1
2.5,it lacks originality but the two main stars manage to do enough to make it watchable,-1
2.5,"It's OK for an action comedy, but I still think it's lame. I'm wondering how it got its sequel.",-1
4.5,"I loved this movie. I'm really ready to see ""Ride Along 2"" now.",1
4.0,"A great performance by Ice Cube and Kevin Hart, a light-hearted comedy with a classic plot-style. Not very original, but well-performed and handled.",1
2.0,"Silly, stupid plot. Just watch it for Kevin Hart goofing off on screen.",-1
3.0,Really wank but enjoyable.,0
2.5,Average Cop Movie but I laughed a lot in some parts. Kevin Hart is fucking hilarious.,-1
3.0,Was expecting a lot worse. Standard fare but has its moments. Watch if you have little else to do and/or need an Ice Cube fix.,0
2.0,"Ride along does bring in laughs but it's only 90% from Hart, if Hart wasn't in the movie I would have given it 1 star, I also felt that the movie dragged on for a bit too long. I don't know why they made a sequel to this...",-1

3.0,"Eh. It was okay. A little raunchy for my taste, but still funny.",0
2.0,"Ice Cube gives it his all, but it cannot save ""Ride Along"" from being a generic, lazily-written comedy. Kevin Hart annoyed me for most of the runtime, and this movie just simply wasn't very funny.",-1
1.0,1 star cause Kevin Hart is funny sometimes. Ice cube is just painful and Olivia Munn is just out of place and just.... Blend.,-1
4.0,8/10 very funny with Kevin Hart being his usual silly self,1
0.5,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. This Kevin Hart guy is just not funny.,-1
3.5,"""Ride Along"" is pretty fun, if your along for the ride. Know going into it that it's not the greatest movie ever made. The story isn't anything new and it can be somewhat dumb, but it's a pretty fun movie with a lot to offer. Kevin Hart and Ice Cube are great, and bring life an energy to the movie. The action is somewhat exciting, which I was not expecting it to be. Some of the comedy works, and some doesn't, but it all together is a pretty fun action buddy cop flick.",0
1.0,3 Very funny moments and Kevin Hart talking too fast. Then end.,-1
4.0,Ride Along is a movie that again I got to choose to watch with the wife and thank God it was a Excellent choice. We both could not stop laughing while watching this movie. I remember watching TV interviews about this movie and how Kevin Hart would non stop try to make Ice Cube laugh and failed on set and in real life to make Ice laugh. Ice Cube kept having that I will kill you kinda look. Basically the story line goes on about how Kevin Harts character is dating Ice Cubes Sister and Ice does not like that. Ben Kevin Hart gets accepted to the police academy and is happy about it and then wants to get James Ice Cubes characters blessing to ask his sister to marry him and for James to accept Ben and see what kind of man he really is he advises him to go on a ride along with him. He does and the funny bone gets hit non stop. Ohh and on a side note gamers will like this movie as well as it has kinda call of duty references. Totally recommended and kids from 13+ are ok to watch this.,1
3.0,"ùüû.ùüü/ùüôùüò I don't even really like transformers but I thought this movie was decent. It's funny at times and has good action scenes. But it also has flaws, the dialogue is corny at times and it doesn't need to be so fucking long. But yeah its decent you don't really have to be a die-hard transformers fan to enjoy it.",0
3.0,A perfectly satisfying film in the Transformers franchise. My major complaint is that it is too long.,0
5.0,"TL/DR: Perfect fight scenes that make sense, Take a break at quiet scenes if you feel like it is getting long Every fight scene hit the spot, Both Galvatron and Lockdown were amazing villains. The lines ""You have no soul"", ""That is why I have no fear"" was breathtaking! I enjoyed the dynamic between Optimus and Cade as well, Optimus was understandably done with humanity, but Cade was able to help him see what part is worth protecting. The Transformium sub plot was also in my opinion interesting, but for those who do not care take a break. Bay was kind enough to give a decent amount of time for action lovers to step away and get more popcorn and use the restroom, no need to complain about it.",1
3.0,"ok this is way better than the movie after it and optimus prime's design was sick and lockdown was an incredible villain but, it's to early to kill of Lucas because he was my favorite character R.I.P Lucas 2014-2014.",0
2.0,"It's aged better for me but it's still a bad movie, it's boring and it's so long",-1
3.5,Underrated Movie.. Story is not the best but definitely not bad as people say! CGI and Action is the best in history as always with these movies! Music is just 10/10,0
2.5,Not bad‚Ä¶ but not great. Had potential but became forgettable.,-1
2.5,The designs suck and it's too long. The characters are shallow and lockdown as a character is stupid. But I don't despise it. I'm has some nice moments and got me to chuckle on a few jokes. The action is what it always is.,-1

3.5,"Last one was better, they took too long to present the Dino bots, lengthy, full of action, but too much action, there's a sweet spot for it. Lockdown was pretty cool for a villian tho and I loved gavatron and the Dino bots, I also liked primes design and weapons 7/10 or 6.5/10",0
3.0,Average.............,0
4.0,"Really under rated, I personally enjoyed it a lot. My favorite part is when Optimus fights Galvatron and Lockdown.",1
2.5,"Terrible movie, decent entertainment.",-1
3.5,"this is one of the more bland transformers movies, they try to make it dark but they can't with all the overage and underage relationship thing, plus the only good characters in this movie were the bald guy and the autobots and galvatron",0
3.5,Unnecessary sequel to Dark of the Moon was still enjoyable despite the nearly 3 hour runtime and the godaweful Transformium transformation and subplot. The action was fun.,0
2.5,"Not good, but it was fun enough.",-1
0.5,I found it challenging to even make it to the 30 min mark. It seems as though the plot was written by a film school student and frankly I think Chat GPT could have done a better job in developing characters. This was the beginning of the end for the Michael Bay era of Transformers movies. Virtually unwatchable.,-1
3.5,"Actually not too bad of a film, deserves less hate.",0
2.5,Feels like this is different from the first three movies but okay.,-1
3.0,It's fine but still just average,0
3.5,"Like Revenge of the Fallen, a mixed bag, but still entertaining to some degree. Not a great of a popcorn film like ROTF, but still a good one. PROS- -Still awesome VFX like the previous films -The new cast of Autobots are awesome and entertaining -Lockdown is a utterly badass villain, probably the best villain in Bayverse, whenever he appears, a lot of times he steals the show in the most awesome way, absolute menace! -Optimus Prime being worn out and force into hiding is very interesting to see. -The idea of the humans turning against the Autobots that sworn their lives to protect them is really interesting and saddening to see. -Sound design is really awesome, especially for Lockdown. -Many awesome scenes such as Cemetery Wind and Lockdown hunting Autobots, Prime emerges from the house, Lockdown capturing Prime, and Prime freeing the Dinobots. -Voice acting is really good, some of the acting is good too. -Tho I miss Linkin Park, Imagine Dragons wasn't too shabby, pretty neat! CONS: -VFX while amazing is still a bit of a downgrade (especially with the KSI Deceptions) -Story is rather messy -Story has slow pacing, especially during the second half of the movie -Some really unnecessary scenes and jokes, most notably the part where it talked about the Romeo and Juliet laws -Some Transformers I wish got more screen time, such as the Dinobots -Some human characters can be seen as unnecessary -Though I don't mind it, some may not be a fan of the Transformers designs being more human like",0

1.5,Transformers age of extinction tries new things and sets up new and interesting plot points which could make for and interesting story but gives up before they can be used in any meaningful way and goes back to loud and annoying action set pieces that don't land as well as they use to.,-1
3.0,"I thought this was a good movie, but definitely not objectively good. The human plot is just forcedly wedged in, and it feels so incredibly disconnected from the original trilogy. Obviously that being said, it's pretty freaking cool to see Optimus Prime wielding a sword on the back of a dinobot. So it's a give and take here.",0
1.5,"O que j√° era duvidoso, tornou-se ins√≥lito e absurdo. Mark Wahlberg n√£o agrega em absolutamente nada ao novo filme, bem como sua filha e namorado. Os conflitos humanos em Transformers nunca foram grandes coisas. No entanto, aqui ele afunda de vez. Rob√¥s alien√≠genas n√£o s√£o mais surpresas no planeta Terra e ent√£o, Michael Bay, arruma um jeito para que eles se superem e destruam mais alguns edif√≠cios em Nova York e no restante do mundo. T√≠pico filme feito para a√ß√£o, destrui√ß√£o, fogo, pedras voando. Quem gosta, gosta. Quem odeia, n√£o assista. Perda de tempo total.",-1

1.5,"Transformers: Age of Extinction, the 4 entry in to the Bayverse was such a failure. A terribly written plot. Characters that where written poorly, both human and Transformer. Galvatron is misused. As for a sequel to Dark of the Moon, this movie makes no references, and instead makes Optimus mad for just killing his friends, not the event of Chicago. Nothing in this movie makes sense. The only good thing in this movie is the cgi, the Dino-bots, Lockdown, and the idea of humans hunting transformers.",-1
2.0,"It's been a while since I've seen this movie but I remember seeing it in theaters when it came out and it didn't work entirely well. It didn't do a good job enough making me actually care for the characters in the story. Mark Wahlberg is a decent main character but kind of annoying. It felt like the started off the whole franchise from scratch again just to make it better but it's in fact a little worse with bad ideas still sprinkled throughout. There were some cool scenes like the scene in China when the magnet machine in the sky sucked things up and a couple of fight/action scenes. Bottom line, it's always a let down when the trailer(s) are monumentally better than the actual film that it builds the hype for.",-1
5.0,"One of the most underrated films of all-time and one of my fav films of all-time. I get why some people say the characters in it seem out of place but I love the addition of Mark Wahlberg. it has some of the best transformer action in it, some awesome moments such as the Dinobots entrance and the battle between Lockdown. the CGI effects are an improvement over the other films and look gorgeous. 10/10",1

2.0,"This movie infuriates me in so many ways. Stupid plot, pacing overload, non-stop action, no emotions and cgi overload with the introduction of fan favourite dinobots only lasting mere minutes.

It is still a Michael Bay movie, but at least it no longer features Sam's Parents, annoying subplots, bad CGI, or terrible acting. What it does include is humans teaming up with Lockdown to , Humans building their own transformers, destruction of entire cities, and DINOSAUR ROBOTS THAT BREATH FIRE. Optimus even rides Grimlock.

Voice acting/acting was good. CGI is near perfect. I liked Lockdown but not Galvatron. Writing was good-ish. Story/Plot was bad 'cause Michael Bay killed of almost all the autobots from the previous films. Casting is great. I love the new characters Drift, Crosshairs, Hound, and the Dinobots. Character development goes to Drift, he is not only a good character but he deserve a solo movie 'cause he use to be a decepticon. Although the final fight wasn't the best the ending is still good because Primes ending speeches never get old. Prime is a goat.",0
2.5,"The human characters in this movie were uniteresting, underdeveloped and just corny characters all together.

2.0,"It's difficult to describe how this ended up so bad because the first 30 minutes is actually kind of ok. Mark Whalberg has some charm and starts out as good as Shia. The problem can be summed up simply as EVEN MORE SO than the other films this is oversaturated with action, CGI, and almost no character development/interaction after that. It is not hyperbole to state this is nothing but action for over 70% of the runtime and leads to atrocious pacing. The acting goes down also as things progress because its just them constantly screaming and panicking majority of the time. The Autobots have next to no personality either once again. The music is generic and forgettable as well. I seriously can't recommend this except if you LOVED 2 &3. If you just thought 'whatever"" of them than skip it. This is way too long and pointless, easily 50 minutes could've been cut.",-1

1.0,"Lazy, nonsensical, and just outright horrendous, ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" proves a new low for the franchise, with uninspiring new villains and a new cast of extremely forgettable characters. The CGI is still good, though it is definitely on a noticeable decline. Action is somehow more incoherent than ever, and the story just feels insultingly stupid at this point. Overall, a bafflingly awful movie that somehow manages to make ""Revenge of the Fallen"" look decent in comparison.",-1

2.0,"Despite having the usual epic action and VFX that Michael Bay and the Transformers franchise is known for, Transformers: Age of Extinction is extremely rough to get through. It is bloated beyond belief and the character choices were extremely baffling and horrendous. Even the action at times can be long-winded slog.

1.0,"Age of Extinction has its moments when it shows a spark of what the Transformers franchise could be, but it still has to learn the lesson that less is more. It uses the tried and tested money making formula of having the male characters run around and saving a frazzled doll like damsel in distress while the robots run around and shoot everything which then explode and then massive amounts of rubble fall. The president and the rest of the country don't seem to mind. It also doesn't help that the movie is more than an hour too long, because it has to squeeze in as many references to Chinese locations and products as possible. The story is so ridiculously flimsy that the character development is limited to the colors of the robots. Oh yeah, that robot is a good one because it is yellow and the yellow one is on our side. Oh yeah, the silver robot is the bad one. You usually know which robots are the villains, because they miss their shots and die instantly. Given that all Transformers movies end the same way with Optimus Prime killing the villain (Megatron, Sentinel Prime, Lockdown etc.) the only anticipation left is to see which newly colored Transformer we'll be introduced to later.",-1

2.0,"Transformers 3 was once a big drop compared to 1 and 2, but here in this kind of Age of Extinction reebot the lack of creativity is clear and Michael Bay does what he knows, blow up giant robots and get a high box office with a T- Rex Transformer on the cover of the film. I have to admit that the last 30 minutes are good because Bay pays attention to robot fighting and it's minimally exciting. (4/10)",-1
2.0,"Looking at the poster and trailer of this movie I was thinking this might be something really good. I had recently watched the first three movies of this franchise and I really liked the whole concept of Transformers; just seeing them do something on the big screen is enough to get my attention. So when I heard that this is the worst movie of the franchise, the robot dinosaur poster refused to let me believe that. How can a movie with such a good CGI possibly be bad? And when I watched it... I now apologise to all those people I didn't trust. I'm really sorry. The problem with this movie is that it has humans. I know, Transformers are all about Autobots and humans interacting and coming together to beat Decepticons, but the humans in this movie are terrible. I forgave Dark of the Moon since it was Sam Witwicky, the same guy we had previously seen in two prequels. But this time, it's the new guy. I don't even remember his name, so let's just call him Mark Wahlberg. Mark is such a two dimensional character. He loves mechanical engineering and hates anyone approaching his daughter. Yes, that's his entire personality. So when Optimus Prime ends up coming to his lab, they bond together. The premise of this movie is all wrong. The Autobots are now considered criminal in this world because of the destruction that happened in the previous movie. Like, what? Dude, even the army was doing destruction in the previous movie if that's supposed to be a real reason. Also everyone saw the Autobots fight the Decepticons in the epic climax moment. And it's not like there's some communication gap between the Autobots and the humans, since Optimus Prime literally lived with the military. So if there's any problem at all, they can just talk about it. So anyway Optimus helps Mark, his daughter and her boyfriend escape from there, and they team up with Hound and some other Transformers (I don't even remember the names at this point, because they don't give a reason to do so). Together they go to The Lost World where Optimus fights the robot T-Rex for which I watched this movie in the first place. First of all, the T-Rex is like, five times bigger than Optimus Prime. For comparison, just try fighting an elephant with your bare hands (except that elephants are herbivores and won't attack you unprovoked). And after the beating that T-Rex becomes friends with Optimus because it's a Michael Bay movie. So then there's the epic showdown battle between Mark and some bad guys. I was doing my college project on my laptop and this movie was running on my phone's Prime Video, so I used to only look at the movie whenever something interesting would be happening, otherwise I'd just keep doing my work. I don't think I looked at the screen more than 3-4 times throughout the work. This is the reason why I can guarantee you that it's a boring movie. I don't remember most of it. Transformers: Age of Extinction is the movie that taught me that Transformers could be bad too. Earlier I used to see Screen Rant articles which said that after a time the movies went repetitive with the CGI fighting and explosions, so I didn't understand what's bad about it since that's literally what I watch them for. But it turns out the reason why I hate it is the other way round. The big, cool robots have now turned into parodies of themselves and the humans are no longer even close to being interesting. I'd say if you haven't begun watching this franchise, just watch the first three and then jump straight to Bumblebee. That would save a lot of time and inner peace.",-1
3.5,"Quite decent for a fourth installment in a franchise, especially one such as Transformers. Would say this is the last installment that was well executed.",0
5.0,"With plenty of deaths and dangers, this film takes on a more somber tone. But, in true Transformers fashion, it has its share of hilarious moments. It has great action sequences, heartwarming and truly epic moments, as well as some fresh new faces. No matter how much I shall miss the old, like much in this movie, times change, just like much in this movie. I like how they started exploring the history in this film, I feel like it adds to the story. I also like the new characters, they feel realistic. There is the father and new protagonist, Cade Yeager, who is trying to support his family, his daughter who is worried about both her father and her future, as well as having some fun, and her fun carefree man, who can be just as serious. The new Transformers are fun as well, whether it be the snarky Crosshairs, the serious Drift, or the violence loving Hound. This movie is a new start, and a good one at that. It, like the others, is underappreciated. I adore this film, and I hope that others will appreciate it as much as I do, as it is a masterpiece of its own type.",1

4.0,Happy Valentine's Day! This week in honor of the holiday of love I decided to watch this movie. And it was well...fun. It was very chaotic and all over the place but I guess that's what made this film entertaining. It was fascinating to watch how all the different storylines connected throughout the film.. All the different celebrities randomly popping in throughout the movie made it very entertaining and fun to watch them all in the same film. It was overall just a very lighthearted and funny film that's great for a mood picker-upper or for just a good laugh. A film I will personally continue to watch during this time every year. (4/5),1

3.0,"Valentine's Day is not a technically good movie. The writing is, throughout, predictable, lazy, or both, and at times, it is simply irritating. That does not mean I did not enjoy the film or that it should not be watched. Valentine's Day boasts a cookie-cutter ensemble romcom plot, complete with every trope of the genre, plus a few you might be forgetting. Best friends become lovers! Two cynics find optimism through each other! High school students decide they should wait for sex! There's even a very vague reminder to support our troops! (I pass zero judgement on the morality of any of these actual plot points, except to say they were predictable). Even the surprising plot lines aren't particularly well executed (a gay football player! That's kind of his whole plot, he's a football player and also he's gay). Beyond plot, the tone is endlessly confusing, with abrupt tonal flips from cut to cut and scene to scene. The characters are fairly one-dimensional, stand outs being a lovelorn fifth grader, a romantic florist, a bad cheating husband, a nice fifth grade teacher, grandparents, a woman who hates Valentine's Day, a man who hates Valentine's Day, and man from Indiana (regarding the man from Indiana, whose every joke in his contribution to the ""comedy"" part of this romantic comedy revolves around how boring Indiana is- am I truly supposed to believe that there are no phone sex operators in Indiana? That everyone is ugly? That they don't celebrate Valentine's Day? That the wildest thing you can do in Indiana is ""leave Indiana?"" As a Midwesterner myself, let me speak for the region using our own lingo- we are a hoot). But let me move on to whether or not Valentine's Day is worth watching: it kind of is. Hear me out; the film is wholly ridiculous, but sometimes because of and often in spite of that, it is fun. The cast is stacked, and using them for a self-referential element that for all I know could have been entirely unintentional was absolutely delightful. Taylor Lautner saying out loud that he doesn't like taking his shirt off in public at the peak of the memification of his constant, public shirtlessness in Twilight was a fun call out, Taylor Swift's over-the-top annoying high school student character emphatically asserting that she's ""not a cheerleader"" made me want to belt out the lyrics ""SHE'S CHEER CAPTAIN AND I'M ON THE BLEACHERS"" of her hit single ""You Belong With Me,"" and even the use of Patrick Dempsey as a doctor made me surprised that he was also cheating on his wife, because, though I've never actually seen Grey's Anatomy, I figured that the man must perpetually play a doctor, but a nice doctor. And past direct cultural references, making Jennifer Garner a sweet, likeable love interest is never unpleasant to watch, Ashton Kutcher is believable and pleasant as a foolish, but nice, thoughtful romantic, and I cannot imagine being upset at seeing Shirley Macclaine make a passionate pronouncement of love for her husband, or not appreciating Anne Hathaway's character's awkward attempt and consistent failure at hiding her phone sex opperation from her boss, who absolutely supports her endevors. Beyond that, the lazy plot is predictable, but that didn't mean it wasn't fun to watch play out. Sure, a football player being gay isn't much of a plot, but having independantly introduced his boyfriend, played by Bradley Cooper, the reveal of their reunion is still rewarding. And no, it's not surprising that the two characters who hate Valentine's Day just happen to find a spark together, seemingly purely because of their mutual disgust, but it's still fun to see chemistry between two characters and the joy that results because of their meeting. Ultimately, I don't typically watch romcoms like Valentine's Day for an academic experience (not that no romcoms have academic merit! I'm just not sure that this one does.) It's not a technically well-done film, and it's not a unique one in terms of romantic comedies. But it is fun to watch, and it is uplifting, and for me, that is enough of a recommendation.",0
5.0,"Movie Review We all know that love can be hard. It will have bumpy roads and huge tilde waves. There are also so many different views on love. The movie Valentine's Day directed by Garry Marshall illustrates every type of love possible in just two hours and five minutes. This movie included so many famous actors from Jessica Alba, Bradley Cooper, Jessica Biel, to Taylor Swift, Anne Hathaway, and Ashton Kutcher. This Rom-Com was released in 2010 after being filmed all around California in 2009. On the movie reviewing website Rotten Tomatoes, the critics scored this movie at 18% with a poll of 156 rotten votes and only 34 fresh votes. One critic named Candice Frederick really hated this film. I am writing this review to encourage you all to neglect that review and actually watch this amazing film. Not only was it a rollercoaster of emotions, but it portrayed comedy and true humor. It is rated PG-13 but after seeing the senseless humor and the non-stop love, I would recommend this movie to any age. Garry Marshall, who is known for his famous films Pretty Woman and Happy Days, set the stage in the beautiful and crazy Los Angeles, California. This movie illustrates every type of relationship possible. The critics mention that it forgets to pause and consider what romance is really about. I couldn't disagree more. This film displays romance at every stage of life. It tells stories from best friends (Kutcher and Garner) trying to help each other be happy with their partners to strangers (Cooper and Roberts) who just met each other on the plane. Even though this big city has so many people, it seems to be a pretty small world. Everyone seems to be connected in some way, shape, or form. Of course, it's Valentine's day. Love is in the air with these beautiful men and women who are battling through hardships of what seems to be a crazy day. As the occasion unfolds, the hardworking residents of LA experience first dates, long-lasting duties, energetic crushes and associations with past love interests. This film is not your typical romantic love story. It makes you dive in and swim with all the possibilities of love with a lot of laughs built-in. Critic Candice Frederick stated in her review, ""Yes, it's cliched and not well acted, Valentine's Day still musters up some comedic moments and keeps your attention"". Even though Frederick illustrated that it's cliche, isn't that what we all want? I have been inspired by amazing mushy cliche love that I see in romance films my whole life. You get to listen, see, and almost feel the hundred different types of love a person can go through from a little boy (Bryce Robinson) trying to impress someone older, to an old couple (MacLaine and Elizondo) sparking the true love they felt in the beginning. I felt the heartbreak, the passion, and the overwhelming sense of urgency in these characters trying to just get through the day. Since, there are so many characters and stories going on at the same time, the film can relate to almost anyone. That's what makes it a great movie. No matter how old or young you are, there is a character or story that will remind you of your past and make you feel nostalgic. Even though it will remind you of your fun past memories, it will also make you want Valentine's day to come faster. The critics say that ""It's just something to watch with your significant other on Valentine's Day. Any other time of the year, it's probably not necessary to watch it. Just a fun, mindless, romantic comedy""(Frederick). I say that this movie is an all year round comedic and romantic film that can be watched with anyone you please. Many characters illustrated true and inspiring love such as buying one another flowers, taking a flight to see one another, and going out to nice dinners. This made me want to experience my own day of unconditional love. The film truly sucks you in and makes you believe that anything is possible. Since its Valentine's day, the film contained bright lighting, hip music, and great staging. The movie only brought the beautiful day light and shimmering blue skies into the shots. No matter if the camera was filming a breakup or a reconnection scene, the lighting always seemed to be on point and relevant. However, the music choice was by far one of my favorite pieces of the motion picture. It was upbeat, meaningful, and spontaneous. A lot of the songs included in the movie have been charted on the U.S. Billboard and are known by many generations. They make you want to sing along or get up and dance. Taylor Swift, who was casted as a love-crazed high school student, included two of her top hits in the film. Many other famous artists' songs were threaded into scenes to make it pop. The music was very enjoyable, but the staging was another great part to this amazing film. It had so many different locations including: a flower shop, houses, an airport, streets of LA, business offices, restaurants, motorized vehicles, and many more. It helped liven up the film and really made you feel like you were going on the love journey with the characters. The colors brought into the pictures were incredible. Since it was a day of love, of course the color scheme was red and pink. There were colorful flowers being thrown at every female in the movie. It made me more into the mood of the film. With all of the great lighting, music, and staging, Gary Marshall really created an incredible motion picture. My overall opinion of the film is wow. You can tell how much time and thought went into creating these wonderful love stories which makes it so memorable. It demonstrates the possibilities of where love can take you and how it can make you feel. All of the crazy characters and couples can relate to anybody which creates a special bond to who is ever watching. Romance can be serious; however, in this film, it shows the funny and crazy sides of love. With the creative well thought out plot, amazing actors, and ambivalent energy, this film is one I will never forget.",1

3.0,"This movie was not well reviewed by film critics, which is on one level, understandable--if you are the kind who likes art films, French New Wave, the great classics, the great film auteurs, if you are an NYU film student or thinks Tarantino is God, or otherwise hang in the ethereal realm of film snobbery, or you just don't like Valentine's Day or romance, then you will hate this film--guaranteed. But if you just want something lite and don't bring high expectations or want to chill after stressful day, you may, like me, find Valentine's Day fills the bill.

Despite an impressive cast, the film never manages to sustain any rhythm as it hastily transitions from one relationship to the next.

It is a great flick to watch with the girls and a big bowl of popcorn. Notably, Taylor Swift portrayed a delightful air-headed teen in the best way possible. Patrick Dempsey, once again, is the gorgeous ""heartthrob M.D."" with a big secret. Anne Hathaway, Ashton Kutcher, Julia Roberts, and Jennifer Garner are among the other talented actors who truly shine in this movie. I cannot say enough great things about ""Valentine's Day"". Not to mention, the miniature Grey's Anatomy ""pre-union""? Mark Sloan, Papa Torres, and Derek Shepherd. What more can I say?",1

I adored it, actually. I've always enjoyed Garry Marshall movies, one of my favorite being ""Nothing in Common,"" because Garry has a knack for displaying humanity quite well, even when masked with comedy. It was natural for him to do a movie like this. I just wish it hadn't been so easily comparable to ""Love, Actually,"" which was remarkable. I think it unfortunately took the wind out of what could have been a pleasant movie.",0

However, only a few jokes work mainly when Anne Hathaway is doing some humourous phone sex with some amusing accents especially when she adopts a Russian accent. The film also sadly never quite lives up to its true potential settling for cliches in where couples argue and temporarily break up only to reconcile by the end of the movie and characters who want to have sex but, in the end, feel like they're not ready yet. This movie is a decent-ish but not really something truly memorable. Similarly to what I said in my review of New Year's Eve, I'd stick with Love Actually if I were you.",0

3.0,"This film gets a lot of hate and to be completely honest, this is my guilty pleasure movie. It takes the same formula of 'Love Actually' and replaces England with Los Angeles and Christmas with Valentine's Day. Most people hate this movie because it is cheesy and none of the characters really have any character. They are all one note and little to no personality. Well I can agree, none of the characters are hateable, except Taylor Swift, and all of them have some pretty good jokes... Okay, the jokes are really stupid but I laugh at them every time. Everybody needs that one movie in their collection that they know is bland and not very well made, but they love watching it because it makes them smile and laugh. That is this movie. Dudes, I say watch it for a date night. Ladies, watch it with your girlfriends and with some popcorn. You might find yourself another guilty pleasure just like I have.",0

1.0,"What is the prefect Valentines Day gift? Chocolates, roses, candy, jewellery, a poem, a teddy bear, or a love heart shaped pi√±ata and a metal baseball bat? Frankly, when it comes to this movie, take the baseball bat and use the script as the pi√±ata. Valentine's Day (as per the actual day itself) is a flimsy, pass√© and insipid American excuse of an occasion. Bludgeoning viewers into submission, Valentines Day attempts to mimic the breezy charm and vocal intelligence of the interlaced Christmas focused classic British rom-com Love, Actually. Lacking depth or connection, the awkward tedium and glum mediocrity of Valentines Day's sticky sweet schmaltz simply can not be helped by bringing in the entire inhabitants of Hollywood. Pretty Woman Director Garry Marshall has assembled what has to be one of the largest bevy of bankable A & B-listers in history. With over two dozen near-famous, truly famous and impossibly famous actors typecasted as distinct stereotypes for every demographic it's a wonder why four Oscar winners, two Oscar nominees, an Emmy winner, two Emmy nominees and a Grammy winner would agree to the frighteningly miniscule on-screen face time. With the merry-go-round dizzy collage of over 15 interwoven hookups and breakups already enough to make you nauseous, the cutting back and forth between character and actor first and last names will simply do your head in. So in the simplest terms and most convenient definitions, to paraphrase (actor last name only) LA flower-shop owner Kutcher proposes to a surprised Alba. Happy-happy joy-joy she says yes, and he spends the rest of the day spouting sappy cheese ball one-liners to his happily married assistant Lopez. Ashton's best friend and school teacher Garner is besotted with her new lover, the otherwise married Dr Dempsey (surprise surprise, he's a doctor in this too). Dempsey inhabits the same building as flaky cheerleader Swift, who is vapidly in-love with athlete beau Lautner. Lautner's high school bud Jenkins intends to have first-time sex with girlfriend Roberts (Emma not Julia). Roberts babysits 10 year old Robinson; who is infatuated with his teacher Garner, who's devoted grandparents Elizondo and MacLaine consider renewing their vows. Stay with me, this is only the beginning. Tough-as-nails TV executive Bates, demands her Number two sports caster Foxx to do roaming fluffy valentines interviews, but Foxx is preoccupied trying to get an illusive interview with will-he-wont-he retire questionable quarterback Dane. Foxx contacts Dane's publicist Biel, who is busy being an emotional wreck as no-one has RSVP'd to her ""I hate Valentines Day"" party. Biel liaises with bi-polar sports agent Latifa over the whole Dane controversy, whilst Latifa's temp receptionist Hathaway attempts to keep her secret as a moonlighting naughty nympho phone-sex-mistress from her not-yet-serious boyfriend Grace. Meanwhile, up in the air, free of the interlocking episodes below, complete strangers Cooper and an off-duty soldier Roberts (yes Julia) are taking a nap and bonding over heart shaped candy. As you can see, the sprawling interconnected narratives fragment in unexpected ways and are simply impossible to condense in a senseical way. Like a bad first date, all you can do is smile and nod. Whilst intermittent, and hard to see through the haze of pink and predictable Kutcher fluff, there are some wonderful cameos, nice chemistry and genuinely heart-warming moments. Even a true cynic will appreciate Robert's grounding and Hathaway's comedic adeptness. The Verdict: Although mortifying and atrocious to your everyday sensibilities; sometimes fellows, a little sugary mush can get you a long way. If you're hoping to get back into her good graces after messing up this Valentines, two tickets and a big box of maltesers would be a great start.

2.0,"It is deliciously ironic that a movie called Identity Thief has a very tough time building an identity for itself to display to the audience. This movie is a total jumble and lacks enough structure to even attempt to become a decent movie. What saves this movie from being a total disaster are the lead actors which had been on a roll up to this point. For those expecting a deliciously dark follow-up to Horrible Bosses from that same director instead will walk away quite disenchanted and disappointed. In a nutshell, stressed father and husband Sandy Patterson has his identity stolen resulting in him building up debt that's being accumulated by another person. Desperately in order to save his job and get his life back, he travels down to Florida to find the thief and convince her to return back to Colorado to get things straightened out. This plot is rather ridiculous, which is why it required a screwball or dark comedic taint to remove the absurdity of it all. Unfortunately, despite the trailers and television spots this barely is a dark comedy, and barely works as a comedy to be exact. Identity Thief is sometimes funny, but never funny enough. It is sometimes dark and twisted, but never truly dark and twisted enough. It's even sometimes emotional and sentimental (very inconsistently I might add), but even that ship sails too soon far too often. Lastly it is sometimes interesting and suspenseful, but, well, you get the point. The intriguing and potentially hilarious premise of a disgruntled victim meeting his money-sucking predator was started by a Floridian teacher, but gets ruined by a bloated and underdeveloped script by Craig Mazin----whom doesn't really have a good repertoire. The mismatched directing of Seth Gordon didn't help either. It is ultimately the cast that keeps it afloat, even when the script bogs them down. Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy work well together and did a great job despite the circumstances, particularly McCarthy. Then check out the rest of this underused staff: Eric Stonestreet, Robert Patrick, Amanda Peet, Genesis Rodriguez, Morris Chestnut, and John Cho. Plenty of good actors and each with the ability to breathe life into the project, but unfortunately just didn't have enough screen time to make an impact. Bottom Line: Resembling a weak, watered-down useless version of Planes, Trains, and Automobiles instead of the likes of Horrible Bosses and the best of Danny DeVito, Identity Thief struggles to find the right focus and right footing and winds up becoming a movie that isn't funny enough, isn't dramatic enough, isn't wild enough, isn't likable enough, and generally isn't good enough to warrant a second viewing---or a first one. It's one thing to disappoint, but it's a totally different matter when you disappoint underneath so much potential and so much talent at the helm.",-1

It's honestly disturbing to me to see the anatomy of a sociopath laid out in a movie like this, but it does thoroughly example both what it is like to have your identity stolen and the kind of monsters that do that sort of thing. Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy are both top notch comedic actors, but some of the scenes were a little hammy, even for them. A lot of the movie sort of feels like a VERY long SNL sketch where people are going, ""Wouldn't this be funny?"" and someone always went, ""Yeah, put that in, why not?"".

3.0,"Review: ‚ÄòIdentity Thief' is an American comedy film directed by Seth Gordon. The first time I watched this movie I was let down due to the fact it is from the same person who brought us Horrible Bosses and I was expecting something in the same ballpark. This is a completely different type of comedy and I wasn't into it at first but watching it again I was able to appreciate the story and the comedic value that the two leads were able to bring. The film tells a story about a man (Jason Bateman) whose identity is stolen by a woman (Melissa McCarthy). The chemistry between Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman was great. The two have different types of comedy and they were able to keep building and building the jokes off each other with great payoffs. As far as overall acting I would have to say it was fair for this type of movie. Comedy films like this don't need to have the Oscar worthy performances, they just need to be able to bring the laughs and this one did. Another actor worth mentioning in this movie is Robert Patrick as the bounty hunter who is after Diana. He is great in every scene, and he sells the fact that he is first looking for a payday and gets more and more frustrated every time she escapes. In the third act the movie starts to lose its footing as it tries to close. I just didn't believe that Diana would turn herself in nor did I buy the reason why Sandy changed his mind of taking her into custody. They did build a relationship throughout the film, but you can't tell me that he cared more about this person than his job that he needs to be able to support his family. The rest of the movie is very entertaining; just loses some momentum in the third act. Overall, it's a Melissa McCarthy movie at its core. If you're a fan of her comedic work, you will find enjoyment in this movie. 3/5",0

3.5,"Corny film, but has some better moments. Bateman and McCarthy are brilliant like always.",0
1.5,Pretty boring and formulaic. I ffwd most parts. What did I expect anyway?,-1
3.0,Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy play two different characters but I enjoyed their adventure. Melissa McCarthy's character is not a good person but you end up feeling bad for her when you hear her story. You also hope that Jason Bateman gets his identity back and does not lose his job because he has 2 kids and a third kid on the way. The talented Amanda Peet plays Jason Bateman's wife but I wish she would have gotten more screen time.,0
3.0,"Identity Thief falls short, even with Bateman and McCarthy, which makes you ask questions of the scipt. Some good lines earn laughs, but too regularly they're cheap and easy. Seems like this comedy needs more of an identity.",0
1.5,"The characters are the same exact people they started as at the beginning of the movie, making the whole thing feel like a waste of time. Not even strong actors like Bateman and McCarthy could save this trainwreck of a script, but at least they made it easier.",-1
5.0,Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman are really funny in this wild road comedy!,1
4.5,One movie that i can watched it again and again...,1
2.0,Identity Thief gives little assistance to an audience who wants to laugh at McCarthy and Bateman's decent performances but a scattered plot means everyone goes home on a low.,-1
2.5,Fun moments but nothing groundbreaking,-1
0.5,"Not worth watching before, not interested now. My bf decides to play it because he enjoys the movie, but I cannot for the life of me. I just want to punch everyone in the face or hear nails on a chalkboard instead of finishing this horror of a movie. Don't get me wrong though... MM is a hilarious actress. I just didn't like this movie.",-1
2.0,"Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman have decent comedic chemistry, I laughed a few times and it has a bit of heart. Shame it's at the expense of a better script, more memorable gags and an identity, ironically enough. Identity Thief's wasted premise lives up to its title in all the worst possible ways.",-1
1.0,Este film desesperante estaciona la comedia mediocre de Melissa McCarthy nuevamente en una p√©sima historia en la que envuelve a Jason Bateman que no logra trasmitir nada interesante de esta patetica Cinta.,-1
0.5,"Imagine a film where a hard working family man with a pregnant wife has his identity stolen. As a result he ends up with massive debts, driving fines and a criminal record. As a result he?s threatened with losing his job. The police say they?ve tracked down the location of the identity thief but are unable to bring her in, so he?s completely alone. Yes you would be rightly mistaken in thinking this was some sort of heart wrenching drama, it?s not, it?s supposed to be a comedy. I didn?t laugh once if I?m honest. The storyline is terrible and the antagonist, even though she?s supposed to be likeable, really isn?t at all. Ok, somewhere through the last act she?s made slightly more human so she?s not a complete monster, nether the less she?s not someone you?d want to associate with. This film tried to do a sort of Planes, Trains and Automobiles with the whole ?we don?t like each other but we?re forced into a situation where we end up becoming friends? thing. It didn?t work at all, the characters and story were not funny. The film completely relies on Melissa McCarthy for the humour and I?m sorry but she?s not good enough to carry a whole film. She was great in Bridesmaids as a token character but that?s it.",-1
2.5,"There are a lot of unnecessary plot strands and narrative segue ways in this film, but there is a decent story underneath it all. Bateman and McCarthy just about carry it through.",-1
5.0,Excellent apart from the Bermuda Triangle but at the end. 19% is very unfair rating! More like 80% easy watching with a really nice message,1
5.0,The rating on this site is really unfair! Some hilarious comedic moments plus a heartwarming end played out by the perfect cast. Brilliant film which worked out exactly as it should be expected to!!!,1
2.0,This film does have funny moments and both Jason Bateman and Melissa are funny but the play is so dumb. How the police won't do anything about identity thief,-1
2.0,Not a terrible movie. I've seen a lot worse,-1
4.0,"How did this get such a lousy score? I LOVE this movie, and have watched it several times. It's original and funny!",1
5.0,A class of the good actors and a good comedy.,1
4.0,"I don't get the low audience rating on this movie, because it was so funny! I laugh so hard many times, the chemistry between McCharty and Bateman felt so genuine and the evolution to its characters as well. |7,3 out of 10|",1
2.0,"McCarthy is funny, but is a bit of a one-trick pony and that trick is done over and over here.",-1
3.5,So I saw this movie on TV and it was some what funny Melissa McCarthy is a funny in this movie she is a good actress and a funny one and that's the best part! I was laughing when I saw this,0
3.0,"Decent McCarthy flick with Bateman as her foil. The premise doesn't hold up well, especially as the movie progresses, but there are a laughs and chuckles along the way - but too few to carry the movie.",0
1.5,Terribly forgettable.,-1
5.0,Surprisingly good this,1
2.0,This movie was less than the sum of its parts. It's only the fact that the two leads are so likeable themselves that made me watch this film to the end. It was hard to suspend disbelief about some plot points (particularly action sequences) and the emotional heart of the film also seemed unevenly distributed (Diana's pathos). Melissa McCarthy is better than this.,-1
4.0,lazy cops wont give the credit card fraud victims justice so he sets out on quest to bring Melissa McCarthy back home to the police. Her and Jason Bateman are funny and its even cute in a family way for some reason how they end up showing a bond at the end and play cards and eat cake in jail awwwww,1
4.0,I watched this movie on the plane to Spain in the summer of 2013 and I have to say I laughed more than I thought I would. I was surprised to see how low the ratings were.,1
3.0,Definitely funny but too many complications.,0
2.5,A solid comedy but the plot drags out and gets muddled by the end of the 2-hour sitting and making an antihero out of a scammer doesn't quite sell to me as a viewer but good laughs all the way.,-1
2.5,Not my type of comedy but fine.,-1
1.5,Decently funny. Bateman makes it of course.,-1
3.5,McCarthy and Bateman do more than enough to make up for the flaws.,0
4.0,Identity Thief is hilarious and amazing. This is one of Jason Bateman's best movies yet. This movie has a great plot. I would suggest this movie.,1
0.5,"The two main characters in this movie are both unadulterated assholes, making you hate both of them, and not give a crap what happens to them. and the ending where Bateman forgives McCarthy is one of the biggest, weakest, and most half-assed cop outs I've ever seen in a film. This movie is horrendous. Nothing about this movie is redeemable. Hell, even the trailer has better comedic timing than this trash.",-1
4.5,Great movie with good cast. Melissa McCarthy was brilliant. Jason Bateman did pretty well.,1
4.0,"funny,entertaining, kids liked it also.",1
3.0,I gave it a 3 thought it would be funnier,0
1.0,"Another one of those movies where the over-played trailers are filled with the funny moments. Melissa McCarthy's character had no relatable qualities and far too many ""outrageous"" moments. Jason Bateman is probably the saving grace of the movie, but nothing could save such a congested and messy story.",-1
4.5,Best movie I've seen in awhile,1
5.0,This was a hilarious movie. Saw it 3 times and can't wait to buy it when it comes out on DVD!,1
5.0,one to watch again & again,1
4.5,Funniest movie ever!,1
4.0,"Although you knew where it was going to end, it was really funny and kept my attention. Love Jason Bateman!",1
3.0,we need melissa macarthy to make better movies than this. a few funny spots but pretty bland as well. not too bad,0
2.5,a 30 minute comedy packed into 2 hours,-1
1.5,"I have difficulty in grasping the funny side of the emasculation of the American male. To the contrary, I find it quite tragic. Come on Yanks, grow some?",-1
3.0,It was ok. Not as funny as I thought it would be.,0
4.0,started off poorly but got much better and the ending was touching. Worth a rental.,1
1.5,I laughed twice. Not good.,-1
3.5,"Made me smile, good comedy.",0
3.5,Melissa is hilarious again!,0
4.0,Really enjoyable yet scary at the same time... Identity theft sucks!,1
1.5,"horrible and annoying, i couldn't wait for it to end.",-1
2.5,"Pretty dumb and flat, but two great actors give it life. Kind of like Date Night + The Hangover I + Harold & Kumar, but not as good as any of them.",-1
2.5,Slightly funny but all in all quite forgettable.,-1
2.5,Not as funny as I'd hoped. Subplots were severely lacking. Acting wasn't great. I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it again.,-1
3.5,"I felt it was funny and I am a fan of the 2 main actors, but it did drag at times. The ending was awesome, I lived it",0
1.5,"Lazy, over-long, and another vessel for McCarthy to show how large and loud she can be.",-1
3.0,"Cheeky, slapstick humour to fill the time with, when one does not want to study for upcoming exams. Your normal run of the mill, unlikely, life situation film.",0
3.5,"While this comedy does have its weaknesses (in the form an average ending) the majority is a bundle of laughs, from both Bateman and McCarthy alike. Even though the material they had to work with wasn't great, it still remains as one of the funniest movies of 2013. Verdict: B-",0
2.0,The intro hooked me in and the next hour and forty minutes left me disappointed.,-1
5.0,"This was one of my favorite Melissa McCarthy movies. It actually had a solid plot line! The curse words were used when needed, and didn't seem overused. There were solid emotional parts that actually got ME emotional. I was also cracking up throughout. All around good movie, I would recommend it.",1
1.5,"Diana (Melissa McCarthy) empezar√° a gozar del dinero de otros al dedicare a falsificar datos y usar tarjetas de cr√©dito ajenas. El afectado ser√° Sandy Pattersn (Jason Bateman) quien para recuperar su vida y trabajo deber√° hallar y capturar a Diana, mientras ella gasta todo el dinero que tiene y hasta el que no tiene. Con Jon Favreau y Amanda Peet",-1
0.5,Could not even finish this absolute piece of crap.,-1
1.0,"What a bland, indecisive, offensive, and all-in-all demeaning film for both Bateman and McCarthy's resumes. If it weren't so obsessed with its nods and approval of upper class lifestyles (not to mention its racial undertones), this film could have a potential generic road trip story to tell (albeit one that's been told before in better ways). Its characters are unlikeable and the over-the-top conflict is, well, detached and forgettable. A waste of viewing time.",-1
1.5,Just awful please read this before attempting to watch my cause brain damage,-1
2.0,"Amusing, but way too long for what it is.",-1
3.0,"Identity Thief is funny and creative, but lacks the intelligent writing and story to be considered a decent movie.",0
2.5,"Would not recommend, a tiny bit funny, but kind of boring.",-1
