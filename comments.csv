1,8469,"Favourite gags?Spider-Man India losing his shit at ""chai tea"" and ""naan bread"", especially funny after Miles complained about ""ATM machine"".The other one was ""Soda: It's a Generic Brand""."
0,4962,/r/MovieDetails is going to eat well for the next year at least.
1,4360,"The set-up for Miles to land in the spider’s universe and not his own was such a slow burn. He’s finally willing to share his secret only to have his mother not be “his” mother, and the comic-con callback from the first movie was a great way to hit the nail home."
1,4087,A Renaissance Vulture was the most genius thing to start the movie with. And in a modern art museum as well.
1,3916,"“We are supposed to be the good guys!”Did not expect Miguel to be that menacing in this movie. Definitely got that overly crazed, stick to the script, unhinged vibes from him. Which is funny since he was the one who committed the greatest sin of all in the multiverse"
1,2740,^(There was a split second where I genuinely thought they just punched a 15 year olds brains out in a children's film)
1,5211,"So was the reason Hobie was stealing random shit from Miguel's lab to build his own multiverse hoppers? He even tells Miles to make his own too, so great, favorite character"
1,5085,"“traffic, traffic, traffic”“oh and here where the british stole all our stuff”LMAO"
1,4805,"I expected a lot of cameos, but live action Donald Glover Prowler was NOT one of them. What a treat"
1,2230,Idk why but I laughed for far too long at the T-Rex spiderman shooting a web and the action words being *T-WHIP*
1,2144,I love that The Spot without his spots is just like a typical drawing figure used to draw characters with the lines in it.
1,1972,"I like how they kept the ""yeah I think it's a banksy"" line from the first movie. Really cool to see insomniacs spiderman included for a second there. It's fucking insane how dark this movie feels for a pg movie, once the spot became super powerful he was genuinely a scary villain, very excited for the next film"
1,1948,i ascended to a new plane of consciousness during this
1,3609,Can't wait to see Spider-Ham and Noir back in action.
1,7229,"""you're not helping""""Oh good""Yeah, Spider Punk grew on me so much."
1,6973,That scene of Miles and Gwen talking upside down while looking out at the city was one of the coolest things I’ve ever seen on screen.

1,2721,"The credits were surprisingly very short for how freaking complicatedly complex, artistically stylish, and freaking long the movie was."
1,4841,"Spider-Man India mocks Jason Schwartzman for going to India on his self-improvement journey. I knew there would be references, but I didn't think one of them would be to The Darjeeling Limited."

1,9827,Loved the movie.  But the funniest part was when the audience voiced their collective shock and annoyance at the ‘to be continued’
1,2251,"The animation in this movie is STAGGERINGLY gorgeous.I’m finding it hard to find anything remotely comparable. No joke.There are obviously tons of other shows and movies with phenomenal animation, maybe even perfect animation, but the combination of art direction and animation in this movie is just a tier by itself.It doesn’t feel random or just for shits and giggles, it serves real purpose to characters and plot and visual information. I fucking love it.Whatever praise this movie gets for animation, it deserves more. This is an incredible achievement. It’s hard to even comprehend how they were able to not only create so many styles, but seamlessly integrate them in scenes together. Not just drawing styles, but literally how things moved, vibrated, looked, felt. It’s insane. Kudos to everyone who worked on this film, it’s a true work of art."
1,7165,I was hoping for way more LEGO Spiderman during this movie. I was honestly laughing so hard that they could incorporate the LEGO universe
1,8995,"I know this will be said a million times, and rightfully so, but holy shit was this a gorgeous movie. Literally every frame could be a framed painting.I love how the one constant in the Spiderverse is apparently JK Simmons is always J Jonah Jameson.They did a really good job of making Spot, freaking Spot, a pretty terrifying villain in the end.The entire voice cast was excellent across the board.If Beyond can keep this momentum, and I see little reason why it wouldn't, then this will be one of best trilogies of all time."
1,9416,I like how Gwen’s world was more water color and you could see it start to drip and bleed into other colors during the talk with her Dad as her superhero and civilian identity were blending together.
1,5710,"Having a central villain being a literal plot hole threatening Spider-Man canon is both hilarious and geniusAlso, just, so much of the plot hinging on the idea that Spider-People are inevitably fated to be sad and lonely (unless they're Peter B. and impacted by Miles) feels really apt considering how much discourse I've seen about how recent comics have treated Peter"
1,3374,"Ben Reilly really stole the show with his muscle definition, striking poses and tough talk!!"
1,726,"I remember seeing that The Spot was going to be the villain of the movie, and once he got reprimanded by Miles at the beginning I thought, “damn, that just have been a smokescreen for Miguel to be the real villain”, but nope. Dude got so much scarier as the film went on and especially after the collider. Such a wonderfully crafted villain."
1,3852,"""Take care of my little boy.""Rio's speech to Miles was so touching. Across the Spider-Verse had a ton of sincerity and heart, much like Spider-Man 2."
1,709,"I laughed when Mrs Chen showed up, that’s the only cameo from the SSU I need"
1,6343,"One of the key aspects of this movie is how it begins with Gwen and how Gwen is essentially the co-lead in the movie.That is why, even though the movie ends on a cliffhanger, it feels like its own movie.  The scene toward the end with Gwen and her dad functioned for me like an emotional resolution within the movie.Had tears in my eyes during that scene."
1,689,Who knew movies about the multiverse were so fascinated with bagels?
1,662,I didn't think they'd be able to top the first one but goddammit they pulled it off.  This is immediately my new favorite Spider-Man movie
1,1903,"""You're acting like this is just another Tuesday for you!""*stares* Lmao"
1,602,Anyone (and it looks like it’s everyone) who liked the Gwen and Earth 65 story and style need to check out the Latour run of Spider-Gwen. The style and story were heavily inspired or straight up pulled from page to screen—it was perfect. It’s one of my favorite runs ever and I was so excited when I realized that’s what they were doing right at the start of movie. 12/10
1,7997,Having The Spot be the guy who got Bagel’d in the first movie is maybe the great retcon since Rogue One explained the Death Star design flaw.Truly fantastic movie.
1,4710,The verbal “Oh shit” I said out loud when The mom said “who’s spider-man ?” As I realized he went to the wrong universe and I missed all the hints before that
1,1613,The animation the whole movie was amazing but Gwen’s earth? Stunning. I was in awe of every moment there. What a beautiful movie and I can’t wait for Beyond the Spider-Verse.
1,2508,"One of the best sequels of all-time!- Cold open with Gwen, telling her side of the story, makes this movie hers as much as Miles'- Spot being guy that got hit by the bagel is one of the funniest callbacks- Miles struggle is well depicted and Brian Tyree Henry as Miles' father is the standout for me- The soundtrack was pretty great but it went hard in the Mumbattan sequence - Everything in Spider HQ was perfect! The scope, the cameos (both animated and live action), the secret revealed, the chase sequence- One of the best plot twists ever with Miles being in Earth-42. I never saw that comingI didn't think it could match the first one but it did! Will easily win the Best Animated movie at the Oscars and has a decent shot of being nominated for Best Picture"
1,2816,"Seeing spectacular spider-man get the recognition is deserves. Love to see it. They actually gave Josh Keaton some lines and used one it’s episodes during the Uncle Ben segment. Miles saying he’s gonna do his own thing reminded me of Final Fantasy 10 and how they say, “this is my story” and it’s fitting. Great movie and it they stick the landing, could be of the greatest trilogies.And Mayday wearing Spider-Ham pajamas was adorable."
1,1534,I've never been to a movie before where a full theatre started screaming in pain at the same time.I've always wondered what it would have been like to see Empire Strikes Back it's first night in theatres. Now I feel like I got a part of that.
1,512,Loved the animation of the Indian section. All the different color palettes of the different worlds were gorgeous.
1,500,Small gag reminder how Gwen opened up Miles collectible from its packaging. That was funny but felt Miles pain.
1,1859,"/r/raimimemes about to have a field day with JJJ still being JK Simmons for both Miles' and Gwen's universes and also now in LEGO form.""New Spider-Man, Same Menace""This movie in all seriousness knocked it out of the part and it is so chock full of references that it will take multiple watches to catch them all.Looking forward to Beyond"
1,482,"Loved the movie, but can someone explain to me, if Miles was an anomaly, how is his dad a canon level event, or why did that matter? That was the only thing that confused me. He wasn’t allowed to join the society for that reason, but then when he was there, wasn’t allowed to leave?"
1,972,This felt like The Two Towers.  Good as hell movie that tees up the third movie hype perfectly.
1,9031,DONALD GLOVER PROWLER…that’s all
1,3538,Watching this made me realize i dont have super hero fatigue. I am just sick of bad marvel and dc films.
1,452,"Love how in universe number 42 where there is no Spider-Man, J. Jonah Jameson is on the TV praying for a vigilante to take on the sinister six."
1,4129,"Did anyone else's theater have sound mixing too low for characters compared to the music? Other than that, this movie was an absolute treat. I was going to call it a slow paced movie but the pacing was entirely justified by the end."
1,858,I dont get why the Spider Society blames Miles for becomming Spider-Man. It's not like he did had the spider bite him intentionally it wasn't even supposed to be in his universe in the first place. Why blame him for something out of his control?
1,421,Was it my theatre or was it difficult to hear what characters were saying? Like the whole Gwen opening I had to strain to hear the words.
1,825,"the way Gwen's emotions reflected the watercolours in the back like a mood ringso chilling, so well done !!"
1,790,"It’s going to take me three more times to catch all the details. Moms snapping in Puerto Rican, Hobie casually stealing everything not nailed down, this movie is a visual feast and I’m almost sad I’m not going to get the same experience with the first where I actually waited until it was streaming, watched it once, then watched again scene by scene catching all the tiny details. Until it is streaming, the theatre is gonna have to take my money a few more times."
1,4096,"I have absolutely no doubt that the writers meant this movie as a criticism of Spider-Man comic writers. If it wasn’t on purpose, I would be SHOCKED. Miguel’s whole deal being, “Spider-Man must never change, you have to follow the same beats,” is a direct reflection of the writers who keep dragging Peter back from anything different, new, and exciting. I’m honestly super impressed that they made this the focus and I have a sliver of hope that they might actually help move Spider-Man along for the better."
1,383,"Something funny I just realized about Peter B Parker in this movie:For those unaware, one of the biggest criticisms of the Spider-Man comics in recent years is how Marvel tries to maintain the same status quo for Peter after several decades of basically telling the same stories over and over again - many fans want him to finally get married to MJ and have a kid together, but Marvel continuously refuses, instead choosing to constantly try and keep Peter in the same state of being poor/single/etc that he's been in for years, sometimes [going to ridiculous extents](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Paul_Rabin_(Earth-TRN1023)) to do so. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9w3jknfNIA) does a good job of explaining a lot of the general sentiments among the fans haveIn the movie, Peter B Parker, motivated by his experiences with Miles in the first movie, finally gets together with Mary Jane and they have a daughter together. However, it is also explicitly stated by Miguel that the events of the first movie - including Miles getting bitten and meeting Peter B Parker - were anomalies and should have never happened.The implication of this is that all of Peter B Parker's character growth that pushed him to finally become a father wasn't supposed to happen, so by giving birth to MayDay, Peter B Parker effectively broke the ""canon"".I'm not sure if this is intentional or not, but if it was then that means the movie was intentionally making fun of the Spider-Man comics' complete refusal to let Peter grow up and develop in his relationships, which I think is hilarious, *especially* if you're at all familiar with the current run of the comics"
1,381,"The animation was NEXT LEVEL!! The scene with Gwen and the paint was dripping, the plastic blowing when miles told his dad to let him spread his wings... Sooo many awe inspiring moments in a fantastic film! Highly highly encourage anyone to see this in IMAX if you can"
1,381,"This movie was NOT 2 hours and 20 minutes long. I mean it was, but considering how many people here are saying their theatre was shocked when “To Be Continued” popped up (mine included), I don’t think anyone felt the length."
1,3653,"What an absolute rug pull at the end there, had no idea this was only a part 1, loved it though, gonna see how it plays out for me to tell if I liked this one more than the first one"
0,1375,"Calling it now, Peter Parker of Earth-42 is going to help out Miles in some way"
1,363,I mean not only was Donald the inspiration for miles he also voiced miles in his first animated appearance in ultimate Spider-Man tv show! So the fact that they literally had him as is homecoming character in the prowler outfit was great! Also I left right after so didn’t see the credits wasn’t feeling good think I over indulged in junk food and I wasn’t 100% sure but was that mahershala voicing earth 43 Aaron? Also that first spider uk Malala Windsor seems to be a movie creation
1,356,"I loved how the Jeff Koons dog sculpture was filled with smaller dogs, and how the crowd stopped to appreciate that surprise in the midst of mortal peril."
1,9948,"""What is that?""""It's a metaphor for capitalism.""Spider-Punk was hilarious"
1,2867,"MILES AT START: I don't know who Hobie is, but I hate him. MILES AT END: Hey Gwen, do you know if Hobie's single?"
1,312,Miguel reveals that he wants to murder the NY Police Captain in every universe and the anarchist character sides against him? 😂
1,1644,"I absolutely loved it! Only thing is, I don’t know if it was just how they had the sound at my theater or if it was the sound mixing in the movie, but there were a lot of moments where the soundtrack was booming and the dialogue got lost and I couldn’t hear what they were saying. Like even Gwen’s opening monologue I could barely hear. I almost wished I had closed captioning. Was it like this for anyone else or was it just the speakers in my theater? My husband and I might try to watch in a different theater"
0,624,Mile's mom is a baddie
1,295,"It's perplexing how Sony on one end spits out the worst superhero live action films milking the Spider-Man villains arsenal for all it's worth, and then Sony Pictures Animation turns around and gives us 2 of the best animated movies of the last 10 years, one of which being on the shortlist for best superhero movie ever made. If they stick the landing next year Spiderverse is something that can give Nolan a challenge for the best superhero trilogy. My god was this movie ever beautiful. Scenes in Gwen's house, Hobie, Ben Reilly, and the Vulture from the beginning were the visual stand-outs for me. Hobie looked like a ransom note glued together from weathered concert posters. Ben looked like Mark Bagley drew a flip book. The watercolor changing with Gwen and Captain Stacy's emotions was gorgeous. One other thing the Miles-universe nails that I think Marvel Studios should take note of is tone. This movie got all it's quips in and funny moments while still having an unbroken moody and serious attitude the whole way through. It didn't have the tonal dissonance of something like Quantumania or especially Thor L&T with that movie's bait and switch marketing."
1,607,That might have been the best first half of an animated movie I’ve ever seen
1,594,"That was an absolute gorgeous clusterfuck and I enjoyed every second of it.Also, loved Spider-Punk. Dude was hilarious."
1,2783,Spider-Punk is TOO good of character which means he’s most likely to die in Beyond 😢
0,2947,"Hey Marvel,I think I'm speaking for all of us by asking you to release that upside down shot of New York with Miles & Gwen sitting together so we can all set it as our backgrounds.Plz & thx.*Edit: [This shot specifically,](https://imgur.com/a/tfNkoTQ) Thanks    /u/parion for finding it in the music video! It's a compressed 1080p youtube screenshot, but it will do until we get a non-letterboxed 4K image."
1,284,I love how Ganke was playing Insomniac's Spider-Man lmao
1,276,"That James Blake song fucking rules. So many incredible moments. The agency of his parents specifically his mom, ramping up, the Spot becoming legitimately terrifying. Spider Punk stole the show in his brief lines. The watercolors in Gwen’s scenes. Legitimately do not think I’ve ever seen an animated movie this ambitious. It goes without saying but if they stick this landing, it’s the best superhero trilogy of all time. Ps, maybe I’m tripping, but we didn’t see 90s Spiderman right? I definitely saw villains from the series but not the Spiderman from the 90s cartoon. I hope we somehow get him. Also the fight choreography was INSANE"
1,2740,"Donald Glover’s return and used as a semi-Chekov’s gun/twist (many people wondered if he would’ve played the live action Miles in the MCU) was well played by Lord and Miller’s writing. I did not expect that Miles ended up in Earth 42 and Miles in that universe is the Prowler. Major Micheal Keaton’s Vulture type reveal.   Other nice surprises* Lego Spider-Man (Lord and Miller wrote and produced The Lego Movie)* Mrs Chen from Tom Hardy’s Venom * Insomniac’s Spider-Man appearance from PlayStation* Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield Spider-Man appearances* Song Heung Min Poster on Genke’s wall when he’s playing Spider-Man on PS5 (star of Tom Holland’s favorite soccer team, Tottenham)"
1,259,"Miguel was just as terrifying as Prowler was in the previous movie, loved that his theme was reminiscent of that BWHAMMM"
1,261,"So my daughter said she thinks the scene >!Where they tell miles, cant have your cake and eat it too, miles responds,  you can if you have two cakes!< and at the end >!there are two miles!< so.... >!he can so it all!<"
1,265,"I hope that somebody calls Miguel out on his fundamental misunderstanding of the ""Canon events"" and their importance in Beyond.Imprisoning Miles so he couldn't try and save his dad wouldn't have done any good -- it's not the Event that matters, it's how that event reshapes Spider-Man.A loved one dies because you fail to save them, and you learn a lesson -- be that ""with great power comes great responsibility,"" ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few,"" whatever. A loved one dies because someone *imprisoned* you so you *could not* save them, and you become angry and vengeful.Only one of those sounds like Spider-Man."
1,762,What are the odds that the pregnant spider-woman gives birth to a boy and names him Myles
1,977,"There is so much to say about this movie, but for this comment I'll focus on one thing.Despite this being a part 1 of 2, I didn't feel unsatisfied or cheated out of an ending, and I was wondering how they pulled that off. I think they did it by pulling a really clever trick with Gwen, namely by making her the main character.The movie's central conflict between Miles, the Spot, and Miguel absolutely did not conclude, but the film still managed to feel complete because Gwen's personal conflict does conclude. She reconciles with her dad, reconciles with herself and her self concept as Spider-Woman after losing Peter, and finally fully sides with Miles to stand up to Miguel. The movie starts with her and ends with her, and so it feels complete."
0,255,“And this is our museum where the British stole everything” 💀
1,2082,"Hobie was probably my favorite character. In a packed theater, I don’t think anyone else caught that “it’s a metaphor for capitalism” but I could not stop laughing.That being said, I love that the movie wasn’t afraid to be emotional and pull their punch with a cheap joke. Which is even more impressive when you realize it’s also a Lord and Miller movie"
1,2060,"I found it really interesting that Miles points out that from his viewpoint, the Spidermen were the bad guys while they thought he was as an anomaly. Yet on the opposite side, if he doesn't become Spiderman, he ends up becoming a villain in the Prowler. Nice parallel plot and I am really interested to see how they spin it with the Spot (excellent villian btw)."
1,887,Cool twist at the end when Miles Morales met his evil alt-universe twin Miles NoMorales
1,1034,How many people didnt know this was a part 1? It felt like a lot of people in my theater were NOT happy about that reveal.
1,229,"It can't be overstated how gorgeous this movie is, even after having my expectations set by the first film. Gwen's watercolor universe was incredible. I loved her intro, so glad to see more of her story. Also, I loved the Insomniac Spider-Man cameo."
1,223,Can we get like a 15-30 minute short of Peter just ~~babysitting~~ watching Mayday at home? She was so cute and he’s such a funny dad!
1,4056,Unreal. Easily the best movie of the year so far. Probably a lock to win best animated movie. I wonder if they'll give it a best picture nomination
1,202,I went in ready to hate Hobbie after hearing about the love triangle but hes so likeable he easily became my favorite
1,200,"Anybody notice the different frame rate when Miles gets teleported to Earth 42? It’s much smoother.I noticed his character and world didn’t line up and I thought, hmmm I wonder why…..Then the big reveal, Miles isn’t in his universe, but that version ofEarth with no Spider-Man.If I had to put a number on it, I would say it’s probably 42 frames a second."
1,531,All the live action Spider-Man got their little cameos but I like how front and center Andrew Garfield's was. He just keeps get the recognition he deserves.
1,367,This movie was FANTASTIC.  I can not wait for Beyond the Spider-VerseOscar Isaac was menacing as hell.
1,182,I loved Spider Punks design! It was also nice seeing the different versions of Prowler.I was pretty sure Mile’s Mom was going to die this movie instead of his dad and that was supposed to be the big twist. Hopefully both of his parents survive the next movie.
1,180,This might be the most visually insane movie I have ever seen. The animation is constantly changing and constantly amazing. The color palettes in the universes being unique is a great idea executed perfectly. Gwens universe looked especially beautiful at points. This really is a spectacle that has to be seen on the big screen. If you’re a diehard Spider-Man fan then this movie has endless easter eggs that even go beyond that. I have to see it again before I can say if it’s my favorite Spider-Man movie (overtaking the last Spider-Verse) but I’m happy to do so because this is a movie you have to view multiple times. It’s just that amazing.
1,176,"I’ve heard that this movie is Gwen centricThis movie is 1000% a movie about parents relationship to their children. Gwen and her dad, miles and his parents, MayDay and Peter B, miles and Peter B. Miguel pulling a reverse Wanda Maximov and putting himself into a universe where he died, achieving Kingpin’s dream from the first movie all in the name of parenthood.Making hard decisions to limit your child to make sure they don’t get hurt. Making hard decisions to let your parent die to save the universe. Making hard decisions to keep infinite spiders from causing self-incursions."
0,175,"Holy shit, right??"
1,1277,"You could HEAR the disappointment from the audience I was with when that “To Be Continued” title card showed up lmaoBut besides that, yeah this was a dang fine sequel. Better than most I dare say. Seeing aged-up Peni Parker in her upgraded mech for the first time almost made me tear up a bit.Oh yeah and Hailee Steinfeld deserves an Oscar for her performance here, all of the scenes when she’s paired up with her dad were beautifully executed. Easily the best parts of the film for me personally."
1,490,"I was unsure if they could top the first movie. The first movie really leaned into the whole meta-aware ""you know the rest"" attitude.I thought it could only be a one-time gimmick. But they've pulled it off again in a way that is still fresh, character-focused, and true to what Spider-man is... At the time of Spider-man's conception, superheroes were not relatable kids. They were larger than life figures. He was a rebellion against the tropes of his time.Now here in the present, we have a story of a Spider-man who wants to rebel against his own story tropes."
0,658,METRO DID HIS THING !!fire ahh OST
1,5964,"I feel like the one aspect a lot of viewers will miss is when Miguel O'Hara is explaining the interconnectivity of the Spider-Verse.Before we see the Web of Life (Spider-Verse)...Miguel shows the Marvel Multiverse as depicted by Disney & Marvel Studios. This wasn't just a reinterpretation, reimagining, or newly designed display...NO. This film showed the multiverse exactly as it was shown in **'Avengers: Endgame'**, **'Loki'**, and **'Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania'**.So that leaves us with a ton of new info.1.) The Marvel Mutliverse connects the Disney/Marvel Studios multiverse and the Sony-verse into the same multiverse. Now I know a lot of you are saying that ""didn't NWH already confirm this?"" but the thing is that NWH was a Sony/Disney production. This is the first time a solo Sony film acknowledges a non-Spider-Man movie. Soon the defunct 20th/Fox multiverse too with **'Deadpool 3'**.2.) Doctor Strange was name dropped in a Sony film post 2004 (which means Sony had to get some sort of approval from Disney)3.) Add the multiple Spider-Man namedrops in **'Multiverse of Madness'** & **'Quantumania'** (which are the 1st times Spidey has ever been mentioned in a film he wasn't in, another Sony approval)4.) The way that Tobey & Andrew had live-action cameos (albeit, in clip show form)5.) Donald Glover's live-action MCU Prowler cameo, (which means Disney/Marvel Studios & Sony had to agree on this cameo)All tells us a lot about how Sony & Disney will move forward.Expect a live-action Tom Holland in **'Beyond the Spider-Verse'**.I think Sony & Disney/Marvel Studios are now a married couple.The fans won."
1,130,"I loved Oscar Isaccs voice as Miguel. Not scary in a traditional way, but you could hear the desperation in his voice to keep things intact. Really well done role. The animation was super smooth with each song fitting the mood perfectly. Ingenious storytelling really. No BS, well layered, deep, and complex."
1,1257,Probably my biggest disappointment (but also one of the more interesting aspects) is that there wasn't necessarily a traditional climax. Hell the movie didn't really follow a traditional story arc in general. Even though it's a cliff hangar the movie does sorta just...end.
1,550,"What I really loved about this movie was that it didnt feel like an animated movie. There's this preconception in Hollywood that animation has to be aimed at kids to succeed or that adults won't go see animated films so often times they force the creators to make the movies aimed at kids. With ATSV they didnt do that. This movie didnt have any of those corny child jokes you see in animated movies or make things more childish, it was a more mature storyline with proper character arcs and everything that you find in live action masterpieces, and I really appreciate that."
1,243,"When they kept mentioning Hobie, I kept thinking he was gonna be some dislikeable character whose closeness with Gwen made Miles jealous.Instead, he was Miles #1 guy and my favourite character introduced in this movie.Every word out of his mouth was gold and he kept coming in clutch for Miles and Gwen.And the way he just dipped out when the fighting began was perfect. I've never vibed with a character more than at that moment.10/10 movie. Will watch in theatres again.Also DID THAT NEWS LADY AT THE END SAY ""THE SINISTER SIX CARTEL?"" WTF?!! I WANT MORE OF THAT!"
1,113,"\-Spider-Punk is the real hero, without him Gwen would end up in her universe much longer\-MCU Vulture ended up in Morbius makes more sense now (see Rennaissance Vulture, and other villain who ended up in wrong universe) (Strange spell only makes them go into MCU, not the other way around)\-(bit reaching) but when Miguel says ""Strange and some nerd in #19999"" mean there's no Peter Parker inside the MCU anymore, and the multiverse acknowledge it.\-two bagel in best multiverse movie so far ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" & ""Across the spider verse""\-the ending of this movie is the premise of the 'Flash Movie' two weeks after, funny coincidence\- I can safely say that this movie is far better and more concise rather than the comic book counterpart. (too much spin off comic, makes the main story comic less exciting)"
1,112,Prower Miles Morales with the braids looked so badass.  Just absolutely chilling eyes.
1,887,seeing donald glover literally made my theater throw popcorn in the air
0,97,Did anyone think Rio was going to die instead of Jefferson?
1,189,"HOW does this movie exist! Completely unreal animation, and the characters feel so alive. There's so much to pick apart. Miles is GOATed, The Spot finally gets his flowers, the easter eggs are fan-service but who cares! They added to the universe especially with the commentary on the Spidey mythos. The makers of these movies truly get Spider-Man and just made a phenomenal film. Way better cliffhanger than that other movie that came out recently, the stakes feel as high as they did during Infinity War. 11/10, give them the fucking Oscar already."
1,331,"So many tiny little details that just flesh this movie for being so good. When Miles' mom snaps at him, the sound effect was a mini Puerto Rican flag. This entire movie was a chef's kiss."
1,262,This film was art. There was such a strong emotional backbone to this story and I absolutely loved it. Everything popped and felt intense. The music amplified so many scenes that were already visually dense to give you sensory overload in the best of ways. It was a beautiful cinematic experience.

1,1026,"After Fast X two weeks ago, it was really nice to see a really well done true Part 1 film. It's also just really nice to watch this movie because it's fuckin great. It feels as inventive and revolutionary visually as the first one felt five years ago, and it doesn't skip a beat with the comedy and emotion. It's a two hour fever dream with not a single visually uninteresting moment. I rewatched the first Spider-Verse today and noticed that up until the Super Collider turns on, the movie looks unique but isn't all that crazy. It's not until that turn in the story that we get different art styles and experimentation, and when things glitch it feels like the Collider is bleeding into the ""normal"" world. In the sequel, the blood is woven into the fabric. The experimentation is on full display at all times. A shot of the city will switch to a different style for a couple frames, and some characters seem to move at different frame rates and are downright amazing to watch animate. It really feels like any constraints that may have been present in the first one are absent. This movie feels like beautiful experimentation the entire runtime. Starting in Gwen's world where colors bleed into each other like water color, Spider-Man India's world where it's all busy and sun-toned. It's all as specific and beautiful and conceptual as the Spider characters in the first film but this time it's entire worlds. This movie is a visual feast and a total pleasure to watch. It's also setting up a fascinating theme about trope infested writing. This really feels like the most successful and interesting take on pop meta filmmaking right now and I can't wait to see what they do to it. To have the main conflict of the movie be that the entire idea of Spider-Man revolves around sacrifice and not being able to save everyone, and have the reinvention of Spider-Man character be the one to say I don't accept that. This feels like it could go so many directions in part two, and that's how you do a part one. When credits rolled I felt like they had to because there were so many moving parts that it couldn't wrap up any time soon. But that end shot of Gwen, Peter B, Noir, Penny, and Porker standing by the portal. I tell you I was so pumped I could have punched a hole through a wall. And what still works about this movie and elevates it from pop visual spectacle to actual master piece is the characters. Miles' family life is still so sincere and well done. Gwen and Miles is a relationship you pull for but when she said it never ends well I was crushed. You've even got new characters like Hobie and Spider-Man India who are so fun and specific to every line of dialogue and every action. The streamlined way they've made to introduce us to new Spideys is so effective that these movies could introduce ten new spiders in a movie and we would still understand and feel for them. Because Spider-Man is a story, in broad strokes, that we all know and love and see ourselves in. And this series is ready to dive into that. To give us so many Spiders you can't help but find the one that speaks to you. And to ask the question, is the tragedy necessary to build the character, or is it manipulative writing that needs its cycle broken? I don't know what they'll do in the next movie but I can't wait to see. I think it's fair to say Spider-Man knows how to stick a landing. It's a 10/10./r/reviewsbyboner"
1,217,Anyone else just wanted to hold Mayday? She was a chubby little cutie. I loved all the fatherly bits that Peter showered on her. Especially the little kiss on the crown. I bet he was the one who knitted the Spider mask for her. Took the time to learn how to knit and did it himself. Love how they kept J.K. Simmons for J. Jonah Jameson. I know that voice anywhere. He is the universal constant for the entire Spider-verse. Hobie Brown aka Spider-punk is my new favorite design. I love how the cut and past look to him. He looked like a mash-up of not just old school UK punks but US ones. Like Crass meets Bad Brains. I want to know the story about behind Spider-Rex and Spider-Cat. Love the use of color in Gwen's world. The contrast between the cold blues and warm pinks.edit: Replacing the IRS agent with Gwen.
1,78,"I love that Spider-Man is such a unique character in terms of his place in culture that this kind of story can really only be told with him-- all the multiple iterations, the years of comics, the winks and nods, all the different shows, games, and live-action moments that you can drop in to build up this character and the structure of him and what he's ""supposed"" to be like-- all makes Miles' insistence to do his own thing more powerful."
1,73,We need to talk about Peter Parkedcar because goddamn that was the funniest moment in the entire film
1,71,I liked how the game Ganke was playing in the dorm was the PS5 Spider-Man game that comes out later this year.
1,139,"The movie was great, but I’m a bit confused on Jefferson’s last name being Morales. I thought his last name was Davis?"
1,65,Easily one of the best movies I have ever seen. The third movie is about to go so crazy. Favorite parts: 1. The spiderman chase scene. Literally holy crap. 2. The intro drum scene with Gwen. Not enough people have mentioned this. 3. Pavitr talking about the romantic tension between Gwen and Miles. 4. Pavitrs opening scene.
1,64,"Let me tell y'all something! Let me tell y'all something!This film is freaking amazing! Each frame is a painting. Forget the story, the voice acting, and the music. See this film for the animation alone. I'm serious. Turn off the sound and the experience will be just as captivating. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse continues the Mile Morales arc from the prior feature ""Into the Spider-Verse"". The movie tells a mature story about destiny and belonging. It gets dark at times and the tension rarely eases. Ultimately though, the film is about creativity. Lord, Miller, and Callaham use the film to argue that no property is bound by either narrative bars or the fan base opinions. Any writer can do whatever he/she/they want with an existing IP as long as they have the drive to build that story. The true villain is not the Spot or Spider-Man 2099. It's really the limitations writers and audiences alike place on themselves when confronted with a well-known character. Spider-Man has to lose Uncle Ben, Gwen, and the captain for his character development. He should also gain his powers by being bitten by a radioactive spider. He also has to be of a certain race, sexuality, and gender. Such statements are now non-viable notions thanks to this film. The animation is the real star of this film. Nothing of this level has been done since Arcane (Netflix/Riot/Fortiche). It may actually be possible that this film was delayed because of Arcane's impact on the animation industry. The style used in Gwen's world is very similar to the painting effect Fortiche implemented in Arcane's animation. Each world has its own unique animation style that is passed onto its respective Spider-Man. Spider-Punk, for instance, is portrayed via 70s pop art collage. Miles in this film is stretched between being Spider-Man and being a responsible teenager. He is at odds with his parents, gets a B in Spanish, and shows up late to meaningful events. When he does show up, he lands in trouble. Gwen is shown to be in a similar situation where being Spider-Woman has placed her at odds with her father. Her relationship with her dad is the catalyst for the film's events and ultimately leads her back to Miles.Gwen and Miles have a teenage love story in this film that is truncated by their ideas of fate. It grows from subtle flirty web slinging and ends abruptly with a painful confession. The romance between the two is akin to Terra and Beast Boy's in the 2003 Teen Titans cartoon where loyalty, friendship, and a sense of belonging tear the two would be lovers apart. Ultimately, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an amazing animated feature. It conveys a message about breaking limitations in storytelling while giving the audience a memorable experience through animation and character dynamics. The heart of the film is the relationship between Miles and Gwen, and it will be interesting to see how people react to it. See this movie on the big screen every chance you get.**Notes** Spoilers Ahoy - The studios and production companies title cards intro was hype- Gwen sure has a habit of leaving stuff around in dimensions she doesn't belong in- Prowler 2.0 and Uncle Aaron aren't the bad guys in that situation. See the events from their perspective and it becomes apparent why they did what they did- Donald Glover sure needs something to do now that Atlanta is done. Now that I think about it, Sony couldn't get Lakeith and Zazee in this film too?- Any Miguel O'Hara theories out there? I have one: He's not being entirely honest about the Spider-Verse. If Miles existence is an aberration outside of the Spider-Man canon, why isn't he allowing Miles to do his own thing?- Spider-Man noir took one look at that organization and noped out- Sony Pictures Imageworks dropped the gauntlet! Fortiche has yet to reply with Arcane season 2 (also starring Halee Steinfeld)- For all that's good, give Brian Michael Bendis a cameo in the sequel. The man created Miles Morales after all"
1,355,"Okay, are we positive Miguel is actually Miguel? >!At the very beginning he was literally going to eat vulture and gave me Morlun vibes !<"
1,266,Anyone else laugh/cringe on Gwen greeting Miles parents by there first names? A definite no-no generally but especially in many ethnic families. I still can't call my adult relatives minus cousins by their first name and am almost 23.
1,424,"This had a lot of that same frantic James Gunn energy, except instead of ""fuck you Disney I'm going to spend all your money and drop a top 5 on my way out"" it's ""oh fuck oh fuck we won an Oscar now we have to keep it up"""
1,56,"The first movie was phenomenal. Animation wise, this makes the preceding film seem like an experiment before taking things up to 11 with this movie. I’d give an arm and a leg to see it for the first time again, despite its very small flaws(some scenes were mixed very badly between dialogue and score)"
1,47,"To say this movie is a masterpiece is an understatement. Lord and Miller are just showing off at this point.This movie did the same “Remember that nondescript background character? He’s now the main villain” and “massive cliffhanger ending” concepts that Fast X just attempted and stumbled on and did them both fantastically.This movie masterfully did the “comic multiverse Easter Egg” stuff that Doctor Strange absolutely whiffed on, and did it twice. Hell, it made the last Tom Holland Spider-Man movie’s multiverse adventure look like fan fiction.The fan service moments exceeded massive expectations - fucking Donald Glover shows up! Lego Spider-Man. The Venom-verse. They went beyond what anyone could’ve possibly expected.Twists you didn’t see coming a mile away.Only one true J Jonah Jameson - JK Simmons.At this point, it’s pretty much a lock for the Best Animated Feature Oscar, and we’ll see if it ends up on the Best Picture list."
1,52,"Honestly, even with the beautiful animation and excellent storytelling, the soundtrack was the stand-out of the movie for me. Gwen’s new theme was amazing, Miles’ is great as ever, and Miguel’s *especially* blew me away. That creepy futuristic buzzing was chilling in the theater. Tbh I can see it going viral in the same vein as Prowler’s theme from the first movie."
1,100,"Absolutely terrible spot to end the film but despite that it was still great.  Gonna watch it again tomorrow. The audio mix was bad though, did anyone else experience that? It was really quiet for some reason and I struggled to hear dialogue. It was actually worse than Tenet's. Not sure if it was an issue with my cinema or what.Edit: this comment is too negative. The film is fantastic. There were multiple times I was surprised at how impressive something looked, so many sequenced that could have been generic were animated in such a unique way. The writing was great, humour was solid. I just wish it wasn't a part 1 lol."
1,99,"This is gonna be a longshot, but the girlfriend and I are thinking Miguel’s story isn’t as straight as he’s telling it. He conveniently shows up in another universe when alternate family man version of him dies so he can replace him without anyone batting an eye?? Yeah I don’t think so. Miguel killed family-Miguel, replaced him, destroyed a whole universe on accident, and is now trying to prevent others from making the same mistake."
1,40,Spot going full berserk and the end credit sequence gave me major Mob Psycho 100 vibes. I would be so glad if the artists and animators actually took inspiration from a show which also went wild with experimental animation and artsyle!
1,42,Didn’t think I’d ever say this considering I’ve never heard of this character in my life before but The Spot was definitely one of the main highlights for me. Too many comic book movies completely ignore the collateral damage from when our heroes save the day and the choice to use a villain that directly addresses that was genius tbh.
1,43,During Spots origin story you can see Braided Miles sitting when the 42 spider is taken
1,40,"Movie is so good it makes me want to rewatch it a second or even a third time. Always one of the best part is when Miguel informs everyone to catch spider man and failed to specifically mention miles which brings us into the whole spider society pointing at each other; also a reference to the old spider man cartoon. And everytime the scene where Gwen sits at the window at miles' room, it reminds me of ""the video"" from YouTube . Soundtracks are also a banger."
1,38,"Did anyone else catch the reference to the infamous scene from *The Wire* where McNulty and Bunk investigate a crime scene, and only use the word ""fuck""? Except of course, in this it was ""Shoot""."
1,43,That kid licking the window was lowkey hilarious man I frickin loved this movie
1,46,"No disrespect to Pixar, but this is the best looking animated film of all time. They upped their game in animation and design with the multiversal characters (looks at renaissance Vulture)"
1,291,"Like its predecessor, it was a great time.I’m not a superhero fan but “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse'' was one of the few superheroes films I absolutely love as I thought it was perfectly executed with interesting developed characters, great animation, and structure. With this sequel, while I personally still love the first one, it continues to achieve like its predecessor.Throughout, the film explores different themes and concepts in the narrative that were a bit darker and sometimes risky which worked very well as it really helped build the characters personality, actions or motivations and setting. As usual, the animation style, colors, designs, and models are excellent and beautiful. The style helps to fit the comic like universe and adds a lot to the scenarios. There are certain shots and frameworks that are seriously burned into my memory because of how beautiful they are. The characters of Miles, Gwen and others were all pretty interesting as the characters' arches and personalities were interesting to observe. I appreciate the emotional aspects surrounding Miles and Gwen's current struggles and family dilemmas as it helped to add some interesting developments even if some small choices weren't too big on me. The voice performances from the cast members were particularly great since each of their voices fit the personality of the characters.The narrative is fun as the narrative explores some new territories that are dark, comedic, and intriguing which were focused and well-executed without feeling too convoluted. The sound designs, musical score, and many of the technical aspects were very good as well as well with the direction. The pacing was also pretty good with although certain moments did slightly drag a little. As well with a few references that ended up getting a little annoying.Despite some small gripes, this sequel still manages to live up to its predecessor and it was a great time. I will see Part One again before Part Two comes out to have a much better view on it. Overall, with Beau is Afraid and John Wick: Chapter 4, it’s already one of my favorites of the year so far.8/10"
1,34,"This movie kinda also feels like a meta commentary on multiverses as a whole. Yes, there is inherent coolness to them that the filmmakers recognize and use to its fullest potential. But it also acts as a “fuck the multiverse” kind of film, where the best part about Spidey is the small-scale choices made beneath the mask. Miles being willing to be labeled as a multiversal anomaly/enemy for the sake of his singular multiverse feels perfect"
1,37,"I like how this film really focuses on Miles's relationship with his mom, before presumably returning to his relationship with his dad in the next one."
0,38,"My prediction for Beyond / Part 2:Miguel is going to be right about the need of canon events to occur for the health and continued existence of the multiverse.But he is wrong about which is the canon events exactly, it's not the death, it's the lessons learned from that. And Miles is going to learn them in a different way."
1,38,"I like how Earth 42 Miles uses better Spanish than  Spider-Miles. I know it was only like 3 lines, but you can see even with just that that 42 Miles has more a Hispanic accent due to Rio being his only parent alive."

1,62,The movie absolutely blew my mind and has forever ruined animated fight scenes for me. The sheer creativity alone was out of this world!

1,32,"Purely Amazing. I knew the movie was going to amazing but I didn't expect it to be this amazing. I cannot describe how spectacular this movie is, I'm left speechless.    It was the most fun I've had with a movie in so long. The animation was so incredible, the webswinging was so cool that it made me want to go and swing off of something. The Spot was such a goofy yet intimidating character. I really loved the little moments where just background of the city is visible with the characters having a moment. The use of colors in the background was just fascinating. Oh man and the goddamn soundtrack, my ears were just in constant pleasure throughout the movie. I cannot wait for Beyond the Spider-Verse!!    I literally cannot get this movie out of head. It's been on of my mind ever since I watched it. I'm so blissful that I'm alive and got to watch this amazing work of art."
1,33,"This, Into the Spiderverse and Spider-Man no way home just constantly reafirms why Spider-Man is one of my favourite fictional characters of all time. Its more than just the superhero, everything about him; the message, the morals, the meaning, what he stands for. As a kid who grew up with Spider-Man, seeing stuff like this is a dream come true."
1,31,Was Earth 42 Miles' Puerto Rican accent stronger due to his dad not being around? Him spending more time with his mother and all
1,238,a 12/10my theatre was super talkative in the first actbut it didnt matter cause the movie was s0 funit engulfed their chattertheyd did stfu when act 2 got realmetro FUGGING did his thingwhen james blake entered i teared up
1,79,"I know this is such an obvious visual cue, but I was still absolutely floored by the use of color during the scenes in Gwen’s universe. The constant shifting of background colors to reflect the scene from pink, to orange, to deep red and blue during Gwen’s unmasking scene, ultimately culminating in a darkened scene becoming an incredibly stark, beautiful white when the canon is broken, and Gwen’s dad quits his job during Gwen’s final scene. It all just worked so cohesively that I’m willing to say it may be one of the most visually impressive scenes/concepts ever put to animation. Absolutely incredible."
1,56,It seems like Spider-Gwen has a type…
1,133,"Random Thoughts:- The soundtrack fucking SLAPPED. I got such big chills when Miguel entered Miles' world at the end.- They went even crazier with the comic book style of the animation and it was great. A highlight for me was the scene at the beginning when Gwen hugged her dad and the colors of the room suddenly changed.- Speaking of Gwen, I liked her expanded role in this; She was a proper secondary protagonist. Can't wait until Hailee Steinfeld comes back for her other character who is also a cold, socially dejected fighter with shaved sides (Riot PLEASE)- MUMBATAN genuinely got a bigger reaction from my theater than the old spideys coming back in NWH.- Plot structure was weaker than Spiderverse 1. This was clearly written as one long movie that got split in two parts. The ending was very abrupt and Miles' character didn't really evolve much compared to the start of the movie.- Seeing Miles finally open up to a mom who had the wrong eye color was CRAZY. As soon as I saw she had green eyes I knew he's in the Spidey-less universe.- Hot take: the chase scene with all the spider people was underwhelming. They went full on Ready Player One with trying to fit in as many easter eggs as possible instead of doing a better, more interesting sequence.- I'm SO glad Part 3 is coming in 10 months and we don't have to wait another 5 years for it."
0,28,For anyone who wants to check Miles throws the bagel at The Spot at 52:29 in Into the Spider-Verse.

1,24,"other animation studios, particularly disney, need to watch this thing and step up their fuckin game. both of these movies are absolutely stunting on traditional 3D animation and making the Disney/Pixar house style look dated as hell."
1,27,"how have we as a society gotten worse at sound mixing in the year 2023. would’ve been nice to understand spider-punk. still an amazing movie though, even if I didn’t realize going in it was a part 1.spiderman will forever be the best super hero"
1,27,The Flash almost immediately has to follow this lol
1,29,"I know this will get buried under the 7300+ (and counting) comments, but I can't even be mad about the amount of discussion happening - this film was fantastic and deserves the love. So, if for no other reason than I GOTTA get this thought on paper: The meta-narrative being told through this movie is executed so well.Not unlike NWH, or a million other movies featuring time travel and/or alternate timelines, we're getting a big dose of 'determinism bad'. I'm fine with this theme recurring often in fiction, but it can get tired. The way it's presented in Across the Spiderverse feels pretty fresh, particularly because the concept is introduced subtly through Spot early in the film (""The Spot?) before Miguel ushers in the existential, high-concept version. Spot is as interesting a villain as he is (initially) hapless; He is driven by the same toxic traits (ego, vengefulness, misplaced rage, self-pity) as any number of other villains but seems 1) to have no particular desire to be criminal, and is even apologetic about it, and 2) seems to be fully aware of the trajectory he is personally on. Spot accepts, if not embraces, the idea that he is Spider-Man's nemesis. He does not reference predestination specifically, but it's clear that Spot no longer believes that he is in control of his destiny - and, dammit, if he's doomed to be in Spider-Man's rogues gallery, he's gonna be the best villain he can be. Unlike villains who lack the self awareness to see themselves as the bad guy, Spot is smart enough to know that he's on the pipeline to super-villainy and just... doesn't see a way off. In this way Spot is a mirror to Miles, who we see, somewhat naively, trying to have it all, as though he is in TOTAL control ('in a hurry to grow up', as his father puts it), and failing pretty badly in some important but not yet immediately disastrous ways (mediocre Spider-Manning, messing up his relationship with his parents). However, *Miguel* mirrors Spot - or, rather, puts an gigantic lens on Spot's apparent philosophy as if to say 'YES. Not only is it inevitable, but your rise to villainy is actually a *function of reality*'.It's fitting that the movie cliffhangs with Miles coming face to face with his, nearly literal, mirror. I suspect the resolution in Beyond will bridge the gap between the free will that Miles takes for granted re: his seeming ignorance to just how much of his life is outside of his control, and the, nearly useless, deterministic thinking which drives Spot's actions - as well as Miguel's. His zealotry for the inevitable is so severe that it actually takes the form of prejudice against Miles. I mean, this movie is using age-old time travel/ determinism tropes to talk about racism; that's not super subtle, but it's very interesting!"
1,628,I liked how the Spot was the bagel guy from the first one.Also unpopular opinion but I thought the animation got a little too frantic and and made the movie feel unnecessary chaotic at certain points. Like someparts of the opening battle there is just a lot going on.
1,44,"That was an immensely enjoyable movie, I'm still digesting it in my brain so I can't do more complex/organized words about it but it was good. Shpidaman is good.I feel really bad for Miguel O'hara, it is tough being the only straight man Spiderman. If I had to guess, we're going to get an extremely good moment next movie where Miguel does a quip and everyone claps, or something.Lastly, including live action people in this movie is going to open up a whole can of worms. I'm looking at Toei and Disney right now, Emissary of Hell Spiderman as a straight up toku hero would make millions of people happy, I know it'd make me happy.I wasn't really plugged into the Spidey comics at the time but like, the bit where Miguel gets on Miles' case about not deserving to be a Spiderman really reminds me of the old forum I used to go to in the late 00s/early 10s when people who followed the ultimate universe were pissed that he was replacing Ultimate Spidey. fun to think about."
1,50,"I don't get the critique that there isn't a resolute ending to this film. Yeah, Miles' story and the conflict with Miguel/Prowler Miles isn't resolved, but this is clearly Gwen's film. It opens on her and she's the one who finishes her character arc through the film, and at the end she has this huge climactic reunion with her father before gathering the other Spideys to go help Miles. I feel like that's as good an ending as you can get for a Part One film, and I know a lot of people didn't know it was a two parter going into it but I don't think they really hid that in marketing or anything (granted, it wasn't explicitly advertised as such either). I feel like a lot of this ""bad ending"" critique is reactionary from the feeling of seeing ""to be continued"" and getting sad about waiting another year, which is super understandable! But my take is that, give it another year or two and people will look back on the ending of this film and find it a lot better, even without taking into context the next film that will almost certainly pay off what was set up here."
1,111,"Overall I really enjoyed it, although I still probably prefer Into due to it's simplicity. That being said, I'll hold off until Beyond comes out since it is kinda hard to rate only half of a movie.Some assorted thoughts:Honestly didn't expect Gwen to essentially be the protagonist here, I wonder if that'll also carry over to Beyond.I was a bit miffed at all the live action Spider-Man pandering, but then Lord/Miller effectively told a story about how Marvel and Sony have done fuck all with Spider-Man in the last few decades and I came right back on board lol. That being said, I'll even admit I cracked a bit of a grin when Donald Glover made an appearance.Evangelion Peni Parker? I'm SOLD.Anyone notice Prowler Miles in Spot's flashback to the alternate universe spider? That's definitely gonna come into play."
1,23,"I haven't seen it said, but the amount of representation in this movie is pretty crazy. I mean, they had a wheelchair Spiderman for goodness sake! That's definitely worth praise!"
1,22,"I don't buy Miles-42 as a villain. I have a feeling it's going to be a red herring. The question this movie asks is: should you fight against destiny, aka ""canon,"" to save lives?  Miguel, our antagonist, thinks the answer is unequivocally ""no."" Anything that disrupts canon is an anomaly that has the potential to destroy the multiverse. From his view, Earth-42 was doomed the instant its spider failed to create the right Spider-Man. Canon must be preserved at all costs.  But I don't think that's the viewpoint of the movie. Both Miles and Gwen, our protagonists, arrive at the opposite conclusion, you *should* try to change things for the better, you *should* try to save the lives that canon has deemed sacrificial. Canon is not an undeniable force, it can and should be challenged.  I think a beautiful way to expand on that theme would be to demonstrate that Earth-42 doesn't *need* Spider-Man to have heroes. Did becoming Spider-Man, the canonical hero, force our Miles to become a hero? Or would he have become a hero anyways?  While Aaron-42 and Miles-42 certainly *seem* to be performing villainous acts at the end of this film, the movie intentionally leaves out so much context. They are clearly planning a heist, as Aaron notes they have to avoid security, but who's to say they're not stealing from Oscorp, or Kingpin, or an evil tech billionaire version of Peter Parker?  And even though they beat up and chain up our Miles, what else were they supposed to do? A random doppelganger showed up on the night of their big plan, spouting nonsense about being from another universe!   Add all that to the caring relationship they both have with Rio, plus the loving portrait of the deceased Jeff Davis, and I think we have a more complex character than ""evil Miles"" on our hands. In other words, I don't think Gwen's ""band"" is the only team-up teased at the end of this movie."
1,23,Am I the only one who had a really hard time understanding spider-punk
1,22,"Anyone notice how Earth-42 Mile Morales rolled his ""r"" when saying ""Morales?"" Makes sense because his dad died in this universe so he would pick up more of his mom's accent"
1,55,"I remember this being touted as ""Across the Spider-Verse: Part 1"" and I was hoping they had since amended it to include an actual ending. Even though we know Gwen's team will obviously save Miles and right the multiverse, it just doesn't stand on its own as a satisfying movie (this sentiment was echoed by other people I heard discussing it in the restroom).Aside from that though, I thought the movie was fucking fantastic. The colors, the style, the humor; I had forgotten how much of a live-action comic book the first movie felt like. So many great cameos too (Donald Glover as Prowler and that Asian shopkeeper from Venom), plus archival footage of both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield (I guess Tom Holland's version doesn't ""exist"" anymore, post-No Way Home). Plus it was cool to see LEGO and video game versions making appearances. I lost count of how many different Spider-people were introduced here, but it was all very entertaining and involving (especially the Gwen/Miles relationship angle).But sadly, all I can remember right now is that unfinished ending."
1,20,Just noticed hobie was stealing things from when they were all headed to see Miguel to build the watch for gwen
0,20,Miles: He's another weekday villainThe Spot: -and I took that personally
1,98,"It feels good to get two great comic book movies back to back with Guardians 3 and this. In my opinion the genre has been on faulty ground as we got a string of mediocrity and downright awful movies with Morbius, Doctor Strange 2, Thor Love and Thunder, Black Adam, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Ant-Man 3 and Shazam Fury Of The Gods. So it’s good to see that good comic book movies can still be made and that the genre isn’t dying at least not yet. If The Flash in a few weeks is great we’ll be 3/3."
1,20,The colors in this movie were almost their own character
0,20,YOU SEE WHERE USING THE SOURCE MATERIAL GETS YOU!!!
1,19,"""I’m Miles Morales. But you…you can call me Prowler.""God damn...that scene went hard."
1,18,I've seen the Raimi Uncle Ben dying on the floor so many damn times that I bursted out laughing so hard when it showed him.
1,19,I love that JK Simmons is a universal consistent.
1,17,"A day later and sound mixing problems aside, I had a sad detail that came to my mind.Gwen's big speech about every other universe's Gwen falling in love with Spider-Man and not ending well implies she probably saw that happen with Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone :("
1,60,We stan woke Gwen and her Protect Trans Kids poster in her room
1,17,I can't wait for this to hit streaming so I can see all of the spider-people in the lobby. Their names flashed by too fast.
1,15,"I think that Miguel is actually...not a Spider. There's a scene--or maybe a couple--where he is injecting some sort of fluid in his system. Also, his eyes grow from amber to red at different sequences, and they're red when he gets more unhinged--venom causing an emotional imbalace? Plus, in the callback scene, why would alternate Miguel's Spider die randomly by a gunshot? We've seen all kinds of Spiders dodge a variety of fast-moving objects so this doesn't really make sense. I think alternate Miguel was never a Spider, just as 2099 is not a true Spider. And he has claws instead of a regular Spider, which I think is because he can't climb naturally--he doesn't get the full skill range of a Spider. (Miles even says this when he sees the claws--""you're sure you're an actual Spiderman?""--or something similar.) Story-beat-wise it's fluid with a couple of things--Gwen's Peter wanting to be a Spider, and having such a personal, emotional vendetta against Miles. He's angry that Miles got ""chosen"" when he wasn't supposed to be, and he (Miguel) didn't. I think there's more to Miguel's story, he forced a Spider arc for himself by creating some sort of venom that helps him hone Spider abilities, that it wasn't a chance spider at all that bit him. I'll be honest, I haven't read the comics and know virtually nothing about any of these characters outside of the movies, I'm coming in as a relatively new superhero fan. I just absolutely adore the Spiderverse movies and enjoy picking apart and thinking about the clever story beats they've developed. You can prove me completely wrong by providing some comic lore, I just predict this will come up in Beyond as part of Miguel's arc."
1,15,"The scene in Mumbaiverse where they're trying to rescue everyone as that massive tower collapses, without a doubt they still didn't save the other 50,000 in all those densely populated apartment buildings."
1,16,"i mean i really loved the movie but, boy, did the audience make the experience so much better! 80% of the theatre were dressed like spider-man. the t-rex spiderman that walked in and struggled to sit as the movie was starting had me dying."
1,16,"I got fired today, During the interview I thought about how Miles said “Everyone keeps telling me how my story was suppose to go”.Became motivated the left the office with my head held high. Is it weird that a Spider-Man cartoon gave me inspiration?"
1,86,"That movie impacted me emotionally that no other movie has before. I loved the movie. They way they animated miles and gwen and everyone webslinging or wall crawling or whatever that’s how i always envisioned Spidey’s movements Made me feel like a kid again watching this made me wish i could be spider man lol The only thing i didn’t like is some the inconsistent things from the first and this one like..|| the young peter from gwens universe in the first one he was older when he became lizard in this one he was younger. The location of the Uncle Aaron graffiti was changed from the first film too. The only other thing is the way Ben Reilly was portrayed it was a bit silly made me laugh tho lol||I started freaking out when… ||Spectacular & Unlimited|| showed up in the background and was pretty close to the camera fuckin awesome. I  loved seeing ||donald glover as live action Prowler|| lol. ||Mrs chen|| was kinda funny.||Lego Spider-Man|| was fuckin dope. ||T-Rex Spidey|| was dope too.

0,16,"""If no one's got me, I know Spider punks got me"""
1,12,So is Miguel basically the toxic comic book guy who wants all super heroes to be a humorless bad ass with tragic backstory? and anything that doesn’t fit that mold is non-canon?
1,15,Any theories as to why Peter B Parker was in Miguel’s world that was collapsing?
1,16,I heard this film had a cliffhanger so I genuinely thought it was about to end so many times. After Miles went to Earth 42 the music kept crescendoing with an epic shot so I figured a smash cut to credits was inevitable.
1,14,"I liked everything in this movie except the pacing. When it was obvious that they weren’t going to wrap things up, I felt like the set up for the next movie really dragged, even though the individual scenes were good. It just felt like 5 ending scenes put together."
1,12,"Moral of the story: parenting is hard.Also, not enough love for Peter B Parker in the thread. Know he took a reduced role and was a bit goofier here but loved how enthusiastic of a dad he was, and it was super sweet how he admitted to having a kid because of Miles."
1,12,Him having to apologize for the moustache is the best part.
1,11,"This creative team does a REALLY good job of portraying Miles’s Spider-Man. Miles has a traditional family dynamic which differentiates him from other Spider-People. And the way his family operates feels so authentic. His family feels so tied to his community but he also feels like I did at his age. Kind of tired of having to make appearances with all the uncles and aunties who show up at whatever event his parents were throwing at their house that weekend. But he also deeply appreciates what his parents have given him and is trying to balance their expectations with his desires. Another thing I really love is that Miles truly embodies what it means to BE Spider-Man amongst the army of Spiders. Canon be damned. If there is someone whose life he can save, he’s going to do it. The other Spiders have, logically, concluded that some people just can’t be saved. In fact, the death of certain individuals appears to be a fixed point for every Spider. While they all have come to accept that reality as a force that molds each Spider towards becoming the hero they’re meant to be, Miles throws that whole notion out the water. He can’t sit by if he knows someone can be saved.So what if he was never meant to be Spider-Man? So what if he’s the first anomaly? HE’S SPIDER-MAN NOW. And he will do both.“Nah, I’m gonna do my own thing”-HIM"
1,11,"Oh my god I just watched the trailer for Into the Spider Verse and realized somethingMiles says he can't save the whole world, to which Peter responds ""you can't save the whole world. Just think about saving one person.""And here Miles is, doing exactly that. This duet of movies has not missed a single connection, plot thread, reference to prior material- all of it is right there. Possibly the best trilogy of all time, depending on how the third one shakes out (it'll undoubtedly be amazing)."
0,13,prowler jordans otw
1,13,"Caught a second viewing today and noticed so many new things but the biggest one is that screen says Miles is being sent to Earth 42 before it’s even revealed. An observant watcher would see that he’s being sent to the wrong place before they slam the twist on them! I love the attention to detail.Oh yeah, and this is my new favorite movieI also see people go to the bathroom every time Miguel explains the entire thing happening"
1,12,Damn I just realized that Tom Holland’s clips from the three movies did not show up because his feat is already erased from all the multiverses.
1,11,"Spider Gwen for me was the best part of the movie. Her story, her character design, voice acting, everything was just perfect. In an already incredible movie, she was the standout for me"
1,13,"Y’all, Miguel is a Prowler. He’s pretending to be a Spider-Man because one of them wronged him (he sees it as ‘Spider-Man is the reason my daughter died’ or something). So how do you get revenge? Make sure every one of those Spider-Jerks loses a loved one, suffers, feels his pain. Miles - “Are those claws? Are you even a Spider-Man?”Miguel doesn’t have webs, he doesn’t joke, he’s a vampire FFS.Canon events are detected by a program he wrote, everyone uses his tech. He’s a Prowler, not a Spider-Man."
1,43,"i expect to be in the minority, but if the cliffhanger just doesn’t work for me. i really loved almost everything in this movie, but it doesn’t feel like i really watched a story. there was no climax. we ended on rising action. the only plot thread that was introduced and resolved in any way was gwen and her father (which i loved!). it just feels like a long, beautiful trailer, honestly. it doesn’t help that so many of the payoffs in this film were already shown in the trailers. that was annoying."
1,12,I must confess that I couldn't understand about 80% of Spider-Punk's lines. Maybe it was the speakers in my theater.
1,12,"I can't write a perfect review, at least not the way I would like. But I can say is, whatever the hell the writers, producers, directors, artists, are doing, please, for the love of all things holy, PLEASE keep doing what you're doing. Because it's perfect. Never thought two of my top 5 favorite movies would be super hero movies but I'm so glad that I'm wrong."
1,12,Spiderman 2099 almost eating the Vulture’s head at the beginning looked like he was turning into Venom?
1,13,This movie did a FAR better job of explaining the multiverse than the mcu. Loved everything about it.
1,11,"I’ve looked all over and I’m surprised nobody else has mentioned the ending where Miles’s parents listen to a girl they met a few hours ago tell them their 15 year old son is missing and they have 0 follow up questions.I loved it overall, but that was just a really weird part of the script."
1,12,"This just might be my favorite super hero film ever made. I loved how upsetting and difficult the story is. It fucking SUCKS to be Spider-Man. You *have* to lose. It absolutely deconstructs , enhances, and illuminates every Spider-Man story that comes before it. What an accomplishment."
1,12,A few things I noticed on my third viewing:When Gwen was recapping Miles’ story at the very beginning and it starts flashing images while she’s drumming you do see a brief shot of Jeff and Spot from the B&W “vision” of him getting killed in the futureI noticed a shot of “upside down kiss” from SM ‘02 when they were going over cannon eventsMiguel refers to the “Captain dying” canon event as “ASM90” which of course is the 90th Amazing Spider-Man comic in which George Stacy diesWhen Miles is in his earth 42 bedroom at the end talking to Rio I noticed some blueprints for Prowler gloves
1,12,"The entire spider verse is literally just a  narrative that justifies and reproduces systematic trauma, just like a college application essay"
1,61,"I really liked the animation the style and Gwen's story, but I think I hate Spidermans in this one, you are telling me that no one else tried to avoid the lose lose situation and succeed?The spot was hilarious, and I'm glad the cast from the first movie is returninng"
1,24,The way they incorporated the live action with the animation had to be the most well done I can recall to date. Was pretty damn seamless how they got Glover to interact with the characters.
1,22,Next one in nine months. Like how long Miles’ dad studied for the captain exam
0,9,The moment a super villan was createdhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzTUUOG9cuM
1,10,Those editor notes were a great nod to comic book readers. Great film from top to bottom but it definitely felt like a part 1.
1,9,The amount of wallpapers you can get from this movie is insane
1,10,"OK so I loved it. I loved every second of it. Art style, soundtrack, writing, everything.    BUT tell me if anyone else had this problem with it: The same as Fast X, I felt like this movie had no 'main event' or climax of its own. Rather, it just felt a bit incomplete and unsatisfying, and a setup for the finale.    At first, I thought maybe this is just how it has to be with two-part movies. But then I remembered how Infinity War/Endgame managed to do it so well, making even the first movie feel like its own, whole thing, even with the most deadly cliffhanger of all time. I wonder why this movie or Fast X couldn't do quite that. And I wonder if Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part 1 will be the same way."
1,10,Just out. Honestly lost for words. Can’t see anything beating this for my film of the year
1,13,"Absolutely stunning movie. I went to a 4DX viewing of the movie on Sunday morning at 9.40am and the hall was packed. I've been to other movies in this particular time slot and it's usually just a handful of people - Little Mermaid, for example, had a total of 5 people in the audience, including myself - but not this time.The Spider-verse movies so far evoke a sense of wonder which I haven't had since the first phase of MCU. Visually, it's absolutely beautifully made and this artistic direction evokes the comic feel of the first one, but even better. I really wish it would come to streaming services sooner so I can just pause and rewatch everything - first for the animation styles and second for the easter eggs. As an Indian, Pavitr Prabhakar made me so fucking happy - especially with the nitpicks about ""chai tea"" and ""naan bread"". Too real, man. Glad to see he'll be returning in Beyond the Spider-verse. Same thing with Hobie; he was perfect. Spot being the dude hit with the bagel is fucking hilarious and I do love how they slowly ramp him up as a villain.My one big con with this one - it ends on a cliffhanger. While it does a fantastic job of setting up for the next movie and I believe all this worldbuilding was needed, the way that ended left me unsatisfied. I was expecting a full closure like in the first movie, but then I looked at the run time and realised this was going to be a ""To Be Continued"" kind of deal. The realisation that Miles had ended up in the wrong dimension was quite crazy tho ngl. I also really like that the Earth-42 Miles has a stronger Spanish accent when pronouncing ""Morales"" + the subtle distinctions between both dimensions. Overall, I feel this is better served when looked at as the conclusion of Gwen's story arc than Miles' - because that is done well. She opens and closes the movie for a reason. But I think many people - including myself - expected this to be Miles' story, so there is a level of dissatisfaction with the lack of closure. Imo, this places more pressure on ""Beyond the Spider-verse"" to be perfect in order for the buildup in ""Across the Spider-verse"" to pay off. Standalone, I certainly do like the emotional beats Across covers - especially about parenthood because Rio's monologue hit hard - but that means little unless it pays off in Beyond.Overall, 9/10. I plan to rewatch it over the weekend, so I'll see how I feel about it after knowing how it ends."
1,10,Between this and Invincible I need more animated Super Hero content. Maybe it's the superior medium to tell these stories in?
1,11,"Miguels tragic backstory is literally the villian arc of Kingpin in part one! He literally stole another Spider-mans family. He pretended he was that little girl's dead father. Did he sleep with her mom too?!?!And all the other Spider-men were all, ""aww, you accidentally blew up that world, how sad."""
,10,"If they stick the landing in Beyond (which I trust them they will after what I saw in Into/Across), this will become my favourite trilogy of any movies ever. Just Wow."
1,11,"I just came back from watching Across the Spider-Verse for the third time running. And I’m planning to watch it a fourth and fifth time.I love this movie so much and it’s not just because as a comics fan, specifically a Spider-Man fan; a fantasy and sci-fi fan, and a black writer that seeing a black spider-man being front and centre of his own series (and arguably being in the best Spider-Man movie of all time) is not something I ever thought I’d see.But because I can’t fault the plot, the characterisation, the music, the character motivations, the pacing. And as a writer of 21 years I can have high standards.It is just all exquisite."
1,13,I saw this 2 days ago and I still can’t get over how freaking good it was
1,11,Hobie must've made the animators not see their families for 2 years xD.
1,9,The kid licking the glass killed me. Kept thinking about it throughout the movie and giggling lmao.
1,12,"When Spot discovers his powers, he says ""Hypothesis"" before going into a hole but does not elaborate at all and that got a chuckle out of me lol"
1,8,Calling it now: mama morales gonna die in the next part :(
1,12,God even 5 YEARS LATER the Prowler’s theme still sends complete fucking chills down my spine.
1,10,"I love how the movie tackles the most iconic Spider-man quote of all: ""With great power comes great responsibility""....but to do what though?To do things for the greater good? (Miguel)Or to do good whenever you can? (Miles)"
1,9,"I know Chai Tea and Naan bread is the best joke in the movie. But it actually make sense. When these things are being imported to outside country such as Britian, they can't just call it tea since they would get it confused with their own tea, which is black tea.Out of respect they kept the name Chai in it. But if you go on street and tell people that you want some Chai, people don't know what that word is. Therefore we call it Chai tea. Same thing with Naan bread. We all know bread means a loaf of bread and not the flat thing that looks like a tortilla. So we used the word Naan bread.Now Chinese tea is different because luckly British tea is black (red) and Chinese tea is green.  so we simply call it green tea."
1,11,"anyone else notice how miserable and stressed gwen seemed throughout the movie?  Rly well voice acted, and the scenes with her father were amazing. obviously she felt terrible about leaving her dad, but she also seemed really desperate about pleasing them when talking to the other spider-woman (Jessica drew Spider-woman?)  who seemed really really tough on her. She just seemed very depressed, desperate, and heartbroken, was interesting."
1,10,Fucking love how a stupid visual joke about a bagel in the last movie evolved in a crucial peice of backstory in this one
1,12,“You can’t have your cake and eat it”“You can if you make two cakes”The way this throwaway line ended up being a through-line both in terms of scenes in the film and theme is golden.
1,11,"I cried like 6 different times, what great character development and performances. Really hits you as a parent."
1,9,"""Take care of my little boy.""You gotta love the layers in that scene where Rio talks to Miles. Rio knew that Miles lied when she asked him to tell the truth on why he always flakes but he came up with some excuse. Rio always knew that Miles had a secret life. She is very worried about him living this secret but when he came up with that excuse, she felt just how much that secret meant to him. Miles of course is very much capable of fending for himself in this secret life, but to Rio, he's still just a little boy who's trying to say he can take care of himself. However, when she felt the weight of Miles' excuse just to hide his secret, she finally decides to just let Miles do whatever he wants but with some advice. That is, if he is gonna continue living that secret, at least be careful, ""take care of my little boy"" - little boy being the boy she knows Miles as. She is talking to Miles' secret life - as Spider-Man. Rio is literally talking to Spider-Man to protect Miles. Although her speech also functions as a sort of parental advice for a son who stubbornly insists to be independent, in this context, it can be seen as her pleading to the actual, albeit secret identity of Miles - a very capable person, to please protect Miles, a precious son whom she doesn't want to be hurt. Honestly amazing writing. Can't wait for beyond the spider-verse!"
1,10,"This movie is insane, so many intense scenes. Also pretty balanced with the slower but important family moments in there. The Mumbai and Futuristic New York sequences are easily the best parts imo, so good. Also a bit underrated but Gwen's theme at the beginning is amazing whenever she is fighting. Gotta listen to it again"
1,165,"I'm going to get downvoted, but I didn't love it. The first movie is such tight storytelling — each scene didn't feel wasted. This one has so many moments of nothing happening, and two characters saying how much they mean to one another. Gwen and her dad was great, but the rest was way too much. There was a scene on the rooftop where Miles is trying to tell his mom that hes Spiderman, and Miles says, ""mom, I'm..."" and  someone in the audience yelled out ""gay"" and people laughed. Because it's not a real moment. It had no gravity. It kills the pacing. Think about how Uncle Aaron and Miles had such a strong relationship in the first movie, and they never had a conversation about how much they care about one another. Show don't tell."
1,77,"Across The Spider-verse... Man how can you one up one of the best animated movies of all time, the best super hero movie, the best SPIDER-MAN movie. Ever since Spider-Verse came out other studios have copied its style from Dream Works in Puss and Boots and Pixar with Turning Red. Across the Spider-Verse doesn't just do the same thing again which would have easily been one of the top movies of the year but improved upon it. The story-telling, the  immaculate voice acting, the Easter eggs, the love for Spider-Man and the animation in a true art form that I don't think will be matched by any movies this year but damn they're welcome to try. Easily without a doubt in my mind a 10/10 The Empire Strikes Back to Spider-Verse's New Hope."
1,24,"For anyone wondering about the ""Cough"" text at the very very beginning, it's something [Lord and Miller snuck into 22 Jump Street and have put in all of their movies since](https://twitter.com/chrizmillr/status/1647105151927472128?s=20), including ITSV."
1,21,"To be honest, If Into the Spider-verse like Breath of the Wild, Across the Spiderverse felt like Tears of the Kingdom, I cannot believe it improved on most of the aspects and most of them worked."
1,19,"What took me out of the movie was the audio. Some parts had the sound effects mask the dialog, and other times, it would be vice versa. >!I was also kind of annoyed that it felt like there were 5 instances where the movie could've ended!< Overall, I enjoyed the movie.Edit: a word."
1,20,"How the hell did this movie only cost 100 million with those visuals, and why does Elemental has twice that budget with ordinary visuals."
1,20,"its mind blowing and the best Spider-Man story ever told on screen from a die hard Spider-Man fan. It’s literally going to force the animation medium to step up its game permanently. Pushes the boundaries of the way you can tell stories through filmmaking. Yep, the most visually insane and off the walls thing I’ve ever seen. Wildly original. I want to take every second of that movie and frame it and put in a museum. There’s a neat little reference to a Wes Anderson film in here too"
1,9,"I feel like the entire Web of Canon moment was a big highlight, beyond seeing live action footage of Amazing Spider Man which definitely shocked me, it was definitely the most Meta Spider-Man thing we've seen in a long time. But I think what's most interesting about it is that Into the Spider Verse was all about Miles becoming just like all of these other Spider Men and the whole point that Spider Man could be anyone. If that film was about the everyman nature of Spiderman, this is about the pre-determination and common ""threads"" of being Spiderman plus arguably the formulaic nature of Spider Man stories always involving tragic backstories and eventual tragic loss. It's an interesting opposite. Yes Spider Man can be anyone, but the same specific shit is gonna happen to him no matter what, in every universe."
1,11,"Perfect, spectacular. Felt like a comic book, right to the end.I just wish they had ended on “this isn’t my universe” and gwen with “he’s in the wrong universe” and cut to a to be continued, with Miles Prowler in the mid credit scene. That would have been such a way to draw viewers back and also be true to comic book cliffhangers"
1,10,"I came in trying to manage my expectations, I did not need it to be as good as the first film which I loved, just 'good enough' so to speak. The fact that I am leaving unsure as to whether I prefer this one or the first pretty much speaks for itself.I was blown away.The action set-pieces throughout were incredible, loved the little prologue with Gwen and the more focus she gets throughout the film. She goes through a journey and has a lot of growth herself, really liked the scenes between her and her dad, you can see the parallels between herself and MilesI like that it's a more serious tone of story with bigger stakes, while there is plenty of humour especially early on, the film starts to shift, just like how Spot shifts from the 'villain of the week' joke to someone who become an extremely serious threat. It was executed very well. Not a villain but Miguel is a compelling antagonist in this film, you can completely understand where he's coming from and I am very interested to see what he'll do in the next film.So many details I could gush about, a lot of the callbacks in jokes from the first film: with making it seem like Jeff was about to jump into the portal, immediate cut to him running down the stairs. The fact that Miles did albeit inadvertently cause the Spiderman in his universe to die, if you watch the first film back or you've seen it countless times like me, Miles does delay Spiderman enough to the point that the Prowler is able to catch up with him and prevent the collider shut down, the fact that was incorporated as a key plot element is crazy, love that.The theme of destiny, determinism or 'canon' is an interesting one. If Miles was not supposed to become Spiderman then was his father just destined to die albeit it would've been under the watch of Chris Pine Spiderman? I suppose that would also work.Need to recover after seeing it 4DX which helped ramp up the action scenes even further. Probably going to see it again soon in Imax."
1,9,"God, everything about this movie was crafted with so much care and love.I'm gonna rewatch it tonight and take notes because I genuinely don't think I can make a list of everything I loved without writing it down as I go, there's just too much to remember"
1,8,"i knew something was off when the “Sashimi” supreme poster in Mile’s room said “Oashimi”, thought it was an error at first"
1,9,"Anybody think Miguel's line to Lyla was an Avatar: Legend Of Korra reference?   ""Lyla, do the thing"""
1,9,"Upon thinking back, when Gwen meets Miles's parents and his dad emphasizes *captain*, she knows what's up in his future."
1,11,Spiderpunk looks like Basquiat to me
1,10,"i think my favorite scene atm has to be miles telling who he thought was his mom that he was spider-man. the long, drawn out silence making the audience think it was a build up to a joke. then when she says ""who?"" you laugh for a second thinking that was the punchline... and then the truth sloooowly focuses into view. they intentionally made the pause that long so the audience could come to that realization on their own, didn’t need to spell it out. absolutely brilliant."
1,9,"This movie was visually and auditory stunning, but I’m surprised that it’s getting such high ratings considering that it’s effectively half of a movie. I like the idea that this is Gwen’s movie and wraps up her story, but I don’t see a lot of critics mentioning that."
1,9,Was all those  “oh shoot” at the crime scene a reference to iconic “fuck”  scene from the wire?
1,8,"All the fans and all the filmmakers agree. No matter what Spiderman film, no matter what universe...J.K. Simmons will always be J Jonah Jameson. Always."
1,10,Miguel with the outright reference to No Way Home —~“Don’t even get me started on Doctor Strange & that little nerd”
1,9,"Man, it just gets better and better on rewatch. The last 5 minutes gets more and more hype (instead of disappointing cliffhanger) the more you watch it."
1,11,Goddamn some of the background spideys had some FAT thighs.
0,9,I hope I didnt ice your game man
1,10,"I was starting to think to myself ""this feels like it's been on for a long time, how are they going to wrap this up?"" right around the time Miles woke up tied to the punching bag.I can't say I'm thrilled that this was a surprise two parter but to be honest the movie was so fucking good that I'm not even mad. I can't wait for the home media release so I can go through individual scenes to spot (pun intended) all the hidden details.Also, am I crazy, or did Gwen murder Ben Reilly? She pulls him into her universe but takes his watch, he's going to glitch until he dies, right?"
1,10,I’m upset that my friend and I missed the first few minutes because we were buying popcorn. Sounds like Gwen’s backstory was very beautifully done.
1,8,"So I realized something when I remembered the scene with The Spot's first appearance. When Miles asked if he was wearing a costume, he said that ""It's all human skin"" or something like that. So he wasn't just naked (not at first but later when they began fighting), but he also lost his genitals? Correct me if I'm wrong but he had nothing inbetween his legs and I checked the images from the movie so did the mutation just made him that way? How does the guy even go to the bathroom?I know that this is a different version of The Spot than from the comics which I know but is this true?"
1,7,"I’ve seen this movie twice now, and I feel like… honestly it’s just… this was something special.Forget the actual rap music for a moment, the original score is just fantastic. The opera coming in when Vulture sees the city at the start has to be one of my favourite scenes, it gives me chills. And Miguel and Gwen and Prowler, all of them have Leitmotif’s that are just amazing. Visually this movie is outstanding, every frame is something to admire. And every universe is different, even if only subtly. Gwen’s universe was easily the most beautiful to me.I liked the first movie, don’t get me wrong. I did really like Spider-verse 1, and when a sequel was announced I was happy and ready to see it. But this - I genuinely love this movie. Maybe it’s because it’s just out at a better time in my life, I’m happier, less depressed, or maybe something tonally or how the movie comes together just strikes more of a chord with me. But I adore this movie, I’d happily watch it *again*. I rate it above the first."
1,9,New to Reddit. Couldn’t get the movie out of my head it was so good. I loved Spot since I didn’t think he would actually be important. Currently planning a video essay breakdown when it comes to digital. Having a lot of fun seeing people’s memes since my personal friends haven’t seen it yet. Dm if interested.
1,8,"It’s one of those movies you have to see more than once to truly appreciate it. That ending hits like a bucket of cold water, but on a second viewing, when you know it’s coming, it’s a much better experience. Plus you can pick up on all the details you missed on the first viewing. Some people say the music was a downgrade from the first, and while the music wasn’t as iconic as the first (Sunflower, What’s Up Danger, Prowler theme), it’s still fucking good. (Spot theme, Miguel theme, and Gwen theme, Mona Lisa, and the ending song). If the third one is just as good, this might be my favorite trilogy of all time."
1,10,More Hobie please!
1,11,"Saw it again a few hours ago, just as good the second time through. Some details I noticed this time:Gwen’s band is called “The Mary Janes”When Spot steals a mint from mrs Chen, the brand is “Venomint”Gwen’s dad is wearing a Visions Academy sweater"
1,134,I didn't know that this was a part 1. They should have kept it in the name. Unpopular opinion it seems but it almost ruined the whole experience for me. It felt like they set up a great big climax and ended it exactly before it got set in motion.I'm not even sure how they're gonna make the next movie last 2 hours. Felt like there should have been 20-30 minutes left. I was enjoying the movie up until then but not as much as the first one. To me that ending felt like a classic case of a studio trying to squeeze 2 movies out of 1 story.
1,15,Anyone notice the way Earth-42 Miles tied up our Miles was EXACTLY the way Peter was tied up in the first movie?
1,10,"Dude, the overarching theme of fatherhood in Across The Spider-Verse is so strong!The captains, Miguel, Peter, there's a lot of dadcore going around.Also, the movie being so character focused can only happen because it's a part one. I know some people will feel like that's a detriment,but I view it in the same vein as Infinity War or Empire Strikes Back.It's the hero's lowest point before the satisfying conclusion. Overall, I just love this movie, straight upgrade of the first one in all aspects.  It explores so much about the Spider-Man mythos and bakes the ""I saw and I clapped"" stuff directly into the narrative.Lastly, personal bias, but all the Spider-Gwen focus got me so hyped! It's as much her movie as it is Miles', and I love that."
1,8,"All the Hobie stuff cracked me up. Can’t wait for a rewatch to get all the little details, like him hating prime ministers."
1,9,I’m gonna need a lot more of Andy Samberg as Scarlett Spider in Part 2
1,10,How is nobody talking about spot going to the venomverse??
1,8,"Legitimately not sure if British punk spider man was speaking English, maybe understood half his lines. Otherwise right chuffed"
1,6,One of the best Trolley Experiment cinema I’ve seen in quite some time.
1,8,"As a child and family therapist, my favorite reference was Peter B reading “How to Talk So Kids Will Listen & Listen So Kids Will Talk”"
1,7,"They really do manage to maintain miles as just being a normal kid , it's what I've always loved about spiderman He's so modest , has no sense of importance over anyone else and always wants to do the right thing The animation was incredible, the voice acting too ....proof there is no such thing as superhero fatigue"
1,9,Damn near perfect movie except for one bizarre flaw…The audio mixing… I don’t know if it’s just me but there were so many instances where I heard characters quipping but had not a single clue as to what they said. I need subtitles for this one
1,9,"Into The Spiderverse had Peter B. Parker relearning how to be the best possible Spider-Man/Peter Parker he can be while he was trying to teach Miles how to Spider-Man, with them learning from each other along the way. And Across The Spiderverse has Gwen and Miles each having arcs based around deciding who and what is worth fighting for and the importance of being honest with and trusting the people closest to you.It's just amazing writing, and I can't wait for Beyond The Spiderverse to see where these characters go from here."
1,8,"One of the coolest small touches I noticed was when Miles is in universe 42, the clothes he takes from his bedroom floor to cover up are green and purple. In Spider-Man history, these are commonly villain colours, hinting at that universe’s Miles’ tendency"
1,8,"Something felt off with Peter B Parker in this movie, a lot of serious stuff is going down, Miles is told he has to watch his father die in 2 days, Miguel is raging at Miles telling him he is a mistake and shouldn't exist etc, and Peter kind of acts like its no big deal and keeps goofing around and hauling his baby everywhere, felt a little over the top?"
1,10,"I love how they made a plot point out of the whole ""canon *has* to be this way"" debate. Given the way *~the discourse~* has been among fans these past few years, I'm so glad some movie out there finally had the balls to address it."
1,7,Did anyone notice a michelle obama president sticker in miles room the first time he walks in. I want to say it was to the right of the door.
0,8,**Nahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh imma do my own thing**
1,8,"I love that while Peter B and Jessica were squabbling about who the better mentor is, Hobie was the only one who taught Miles anything and actually supported him. He won the competition that he wasn't even a part of."
1,6,"Did anyone else notice like a theme of mentor and mentee. In the previous movie we saw all the spiders mentor miles and help him become his own Spider-Man like the fat Peter showed him the practical stuff. The perfect Peter was more on the philosophical Gwen taught him to be more acrobatic etc. Then in this movie there’s like a switch all of a sudden miles is shown to be the perfect philosophical mentor like he is the guide that every Spider-Man should aim for always trying to protect everyone no matter the cost. Then we have Gwen in this movie she’s a scared and alone kid who doesn’t know how to process her emotions and trauma properly so she’s lashing out on her father and ex-band mates if instead of Miguel and Jess coming out of the portal we had Peter B.Parker the perfect Peter I think he would have told Gwen to confront her trauma talk about it with her father and not run away as that is the worse thing you can do as it will pile up and all come crashing down like we see later in the movie. But instead she gets Jess who taught her how to practically become a better spiderwomen but not how to process her feeling and mature emotionally.  We can see the duality of a mentor how if the mentor isn’t good it could lead the person astray and they not even know it until it’s too late as you trust a mentor whole heartedly. But if you can find someone who can guide you back onto the right path then you can start to improve, so I think the next movie is gonna be about how miles will ‘mentor’(used loosely) the whole spider verse on how they should strive to protect everyone and sacrifice no one."
1,8,Spider-punk was awesome and I like how he give tip to Miles Morales on how to use his powers.
1,8,I could have used subtitles for Spider Punk lol
1,9,"a small detail, but when miles first meets spider-man at the collider in ITSV his spider-scene is green/purple and peter’s are red/blue, but then miles’ change into red/blue too. thought that was a cool way to foreshadow miles becoming the prowler if he didn’t have the influence of spider-man to change his canon event."
1,9,Pavitr Prabhakar(Indian Spider-man) is voiced by the guy who play Dopinder (The cab driver) in Deadpool.The Universes are closing in
1,8,Peter B. Parker explaining why he wanted Miles to hold Mayday is one of my favorite scenes from the movie and its sad that more people arent talking about that scene
1,6,"One of my favorite jokes was when the Koons balloon dog sculpture gets destroyed and it's a pinata with little balloon dogs inside. Later on the same guy from the last movie goes,"" huh, must be Banksy."""
1,10,"Loved the movie.Miguel is explaining the Spider-Verse as if he knew everything about it but it was shown multiple times in the movie that their model isn't perfect.I expect the third movie to explain the real reason why his universe was destroyed.Perhaps bring it back again, introducing the ""True Spider-Verse"".And please more Miles and Gwen moments."
1,10,But when the 50's 2D spiderman swung at him and just went straight past. Omg that might be the hardest I've ever laughed in a theater
1,9,I don't think I've ever seen a movie more than once in theaters. But I will happily be watching this again this Friday with my wife. It is just such an amazing movie.
1,6,"This movie is about to be the next Dark Knight/Spider-man 2 of animated superhero movies, imo. it kicked so much ass and blew me away especially the second and third act. If Beyond really nailed the conclusion, then the Spider-verse as a trilogy has a big chance to become the best Spider-man trilogy, followed by Sam raimi's trilogy.It honestly amazing how the way it tackled the multiverse really blows the entire MCU's phase 4 out of the water."
1,7,"Okay so I finally got the chance to see this yesterday. Absolutely blown away. A visually stunning movie with plenty of action and heart felt moments.And the ending. I know a lot of people are annoyed by the cliffhanger and I get it, but Earth-42 Miles being the Prowler just made my jaw drop. I am gutted that we have to wait until the end of March 2024 though. Really hoping it's not delayed.Overall, a solid sequel where the humour lands, the story expands and the gut punches roll."
1,7,"Can't wait to see Miles's new suit, since his current one is torn. Will he tone down the red armpits, or make them even bigger out of spite?"
1,8,"A privilege to see it on the big screen in all it's glory. All you could've hoped for after a 4.5 year wait. Can't wait to see it again. Sad at the thought of it possibly all being over in 9 months, these worlds, characters, soundtrack and animation style have so much more they could give - all of them combine into a perfect concoction for success."
1,8,Did anyone feel that the cannon event symbolizes how fans react to writers changing things and introducing new variables?I mean Miles Morales got some criticism when introduced. Now he's a fan favorite.
1,9,"I can’t stop thinking about how badass the end of this movie was, with Miles being calm and collected in the face of some seemingly insurmountable odds. The growth of his character across both this and the previous movie is so good. For a movie that’s clearly meant to be the dark middle chapter of a trilogy I was really pleasantly surprised how positive some of the notes this movie ends on were. And obviously it was visually arresting"
1,7,I laughed the hardest with the little kid licking the train windows hahahaha
1,14,"I adored the movie (I've seen it twice already), but I have some issues with it:1. I don’t like how all of the Spider-People are so quick to side with Miguel. Spider-Man is a hero that stands-up for the little guy and always tries to save every person. I don’t believe that hundreds of Spider-People would let uncles and police captains die just because they are “canon events”. Spider-Man is the type of person that would save Captain Morales while also finding a way to stop a multiversal collapse. It doesn’t make sense to me that Miles is the only Spider-Person to hold this ideology. That goes against everything we know about the character across all iterations.2. Peter B Parker was a standout for me in ITSV and I’m not the biggest fan that he’s been reduced to a comic relief character. I understand that he’s happy now, but I don’t like that he doesn’t take the situation seriously and doesn’t show a lot of concern for Miles’ plight or the possibility of a multiversal collapse. I also cringed when Peter implied that Miles would feel better about his dad dying if he just held Mayday. Does Peter not remember how heart-wrenching it was to lose his own father figure (Uncle Ben)? Having a baby doesn't magically erase that pain. Weirdly out of character."
1,73,"I guess I'm definitely in the minority, but I'm a little shocked at the glowing reception this movie is getting. I was so disappointed because the first movie is incredible.Visually it was STUNNING like wow wow wow. Music was excellent. But I felt the script was a **mess.**This one abandoned the 3 act structure to jam pack as much as possible in its runtime. I kept waiting for a climax that never happened. I get that it's a part 1 so not everything will be resolved, but the runtime was devoted more to fanservice than telling a concise plot. It didn't need to be over 2 hours, honestly.Instead, it felt more like a Marvel Studios movie this time. You got gratuitous moments devoted to fanservice, you got characters making unnatural ""cool superhero poses"" (I don't remember this being a thing in the first movie, so why now?), and you've got a plot bogged down with explanations and over-long dramatic scenes that wrecked the pacing throughout.Edit: Also, writer/producer Phil Lord tweeted about asking your theater staff to raise the volume if it's too low. So Sony knew the audio mixing was bad, and they released it as is."
1,5,"I really enjoyed it but, admittedly, had no idea it was a “*To be continued…*” going in so I did leave feeling a little deflated, in a way."
1,8,"This comment has been edited, and the account purged, in protest to Reddit's API policy changes, and the awful response from Reddit management to valid concerns from the communities of developers, people with disabilities, and moderators.

1,8,Uncle Aaron can finally get Miles the battle pass
1,8,"My two big takeaways:1. Spider-Gwen's origin is the best AU Marvel has done in like 20 years. I loved that they kept it pretty much the same in the first movie but to actually see it in full here was worth the ticket price by itself. I imagine that Jason Latour and Robbie Rodriguez... are not getting paid for this, but I hope they enjoyed it anyway. She was the core of this movie. 2. Right now between the ending of No Way Home and the current arc of the Amazing Spider-Man comic, Marvel has never been as hardline on the stance that Spider-Man is popular because of how sad he is. His current book is so bad, so antithetical to what fans of the character actually want, that it's unfavorably colored online perception of *American comics in general.* So to see this movie so loudly protest this treatment of one of the three biggest characters in the medium is really profound."
1,7,"Wow I don't usually get blown away by movies much anymore but this was (pardon the pun) Amazing!This was the most ""live action"" feeling animated movie I can remember. I can't think of many (especially western) animated movies that have so many great long scenes of character driven dialogue. When you look back on this 2 and a half hour movie, there weren't too many action set pieces. The ones we got were of course brilliantly animated,  particularly fight scenes with the spot where the angle changes are all accounted for.I could sit here praising this movie for hours, without a doubt the best ""part one"" film I've seen in years. Even though it ends of a cliffhanger I still felt more than satisfied, and very excited for Beyond the Spiderverse!Also as a huge Spiderman fan, some very nice cameos both live action and animated!"
1,8,"Probably in the minority here but this is what I wanted NWH to be instead of whatever it was, this was beautiful"
1,7,I recognize that voice anywhere. Jack Quaid was Gwen’s Peter that died in the intro. He’d be a neat Spider-Man voice.
1,7,Ok here's my theory... Miles was never supposed to be Spiderman right? So the canon shouldn't apply to him. Every Spiderman is fated to go through these sad difficult times. But after he met him Peter B. Parker's life turned around. He's the anomaly but in a good way... Miles is the exception...Also Miles' universe's Peter Parker probably already triggered the canon event for his own universe right?
1,8,"Love the movie, but holy fuck idk bout y’all but if future movies are gonna get faster and more crammed full with detail in each scene idk if I’m gonna be able to keep up it with all. I mean it’s a good thing but goddiggity damn.That train scene and music was Hans zimmer levels of hype and action, damn"
1,5,I don't know how the hell they made this even better than the first.Just fucking awe after the credits rolled.
1,6,This is probably the first movie I’ve ever seen where I knew it was going to end but I tried hard to convince myself it won’t cause I wanted it to go longer. Like when Gwen is rounding everyone up and narrating I was like no no this can’t be it just let some montage music play but then I heard the little closing build up music kick in and then “ to be continued “ popped up.
1,7,"Of all the movies I've seen in the past year involving a multiversal bagel villain, this one was the best, and that's saying a lot."
1,9,I love how Spot is almost like a cosmic terror by the end
1,7,Miles and Gwen are so well written together. Hopefully they get a happy ending together.
0,7,[deleted]
1,8,"The teacher at the beginning of the movie telling him to stick to his story and then ""evryone is telling me how my story is supposed to go, nah imma do my own thing"". im sobbing this movie is so good."
1,9,"I absolutely fucking loved the scene where Hobie encourages Miles to break out of the cage, giving him the advice to use his palms and to not back down against Miguel. I think one of my favourite scenes in the movie along with Rio having a talk on the roof with Miles.Only slight gripe I have is that I wish they made the ""earth-42"" sign on the computer more subtle when Miles was going back so that it was easier to miss, I saw it the moment it came up so it kind of ruined the twist for me as I was just sitting there waiting for it to come. Aside from that though, have the mention the soundtrack, so so so SO fucking good, was perfect in every scene"
1,6,"It strains and bends under the enormous heavy lifting it needs to do as a part 1. And yet it still ended up becoming my favorite spiderman movie PERIODI refuse to die before the last one comes out, so help me."
1,5,"Okay, I wanted to rip on you nerds so bad for making this one of the highest rated movie ever but after watching it... I get it. I kind of hate superhero movies at this point, but I really really get it.The animation in this movie is the best I've ever seen and probably will ever see (until part 3 comes out I guess). This is not an exaggeration, this movie is STUNNING. And so creative, and layered, and even like super experimental? This takes the superhero movie genre and completely turns it on its head. The action scenes are fun and thrilling, the dramatic scenes are really great and nuanced, the characters fleshed out and interesting. Hell, the music is even good and that was my biggest complaint about the first one! It literally surpasses the first film in every way.I have some minor gripes but nothing that really killed my enjoyment. I think a lot of the humour was great but some of the jokes were a little lame (chai tea was a banger though). But people were dying laughing in the theatre so could've been just me. As well, like anytime there's a movie with multiverses and like time travel and all that shit, there's going to be a ton of plot holes. So much so they made the villain a literal plot hole lol. I think if you can just turn your brain off for a second and just remember you're watching an animated movie about spider-man the plot holes won't bug you as much—still bugged me just a little. And like this story isn't complete so it's hard to gauge it as a whole just yet, but if they keep it the same pace as this movie I think it could be one of the best trilogies of the modern era.It really is a love letter to the character of Spider-Man from the history, to the character's place in popular culture. I like thematically how it talked about the bond between parent and child and felt it was really moving and made sense with the character of Spider-Man. There's been so many superhero and multi-verse movies at this point and it's really hard to do something that is not only original but just fucking good, and worth seeing. This movie accomplishes that almost Herculean feat. The ending really surprised me cause I went int completely blind, my whole theatre was so into it! Will go down as a classic. As I was leaving the theatre and waiting for my friend to get out of the bathroom I saw a kid, probably around 9 or 10 come out of the movie and he was just looking at the poster art in awe. This is what it's all about.Punk Spider-Man needs his own spinoff movie or show or something."
1,8,"In a year when part 2 comes out,  nobody will be complaining about how this one was ""half a movie""."
1,6,"Saw the new mix of this today, which I’m dubbing the “I’m Going Home Cut”. Honestly I never had problems with the sound in my theaters the previous two times I watched this. But I specifically noticed they took out a line when Miles shocks Miguel off the train, he originally said “Nah I’mma do my own thing. Sorry man, I’m going home.” They took out the second sentence. Just something I noticed Movie is still a 10/10"
1,7,"The Art, the music, and the music was all phenomenal.I loved the ending where it was revealed that in that Earth Miles was the Prowler that twist was amazing. Every time they showed Gwen's apartment I was just blow away by art style. I also loved how they started the movie off from Gwen's perspective."
1,7,does anyone know the song that plays when Miles and Gwen have their little reunion date in costume?
1,8,it suckedthat it ended
1,7,The lead up to the part where we find out Miles and Gwen were in different universes was very Silence of the Lambs
1,8,"I thought I was burnt out on superhero movies going into this and it turns out I am just burnt out on mediocre to shit quality superhero moviesThis was a breath of fresh air and what the genre is sorely missing. The animation was immaculate, the writing was emotional and it took its characters seriously."
1,7,Between this and EEAAO it has been a big couple of years for bagels
1,7,"I love how it started off differently with Gwen's story in a different universe instead of Miles. Her universe is seen more differently with Miles with a lot more colors in it. Not sure if it was the way her universe was, a way of showing her emotions, or maybe both. Heart wrenching to see Gwen and her father's reaction to her identity reveal.With Miles, I like how they showed him struggling to balance his school/home life and superhero stuff as he becomes distant from family and arrives late to any important event. Even when he has a family celebration to attend to, he never seems to catch a break. Just goes to show being a superhero can be stressful as a teen! It's however very impressive that he has straight A's in almost all of his classes with everything going on.With what the writers did with Spot, it's brilliant that they made a minor side character from the first film to be a secondary antagonist to Miles. I had to go back to rewatch that scene and Spot was indeed only shown in the first film when Miles threw the bagel at his face while escaping the facility! It was great that Miles brought up men's mental health in a somewhat casual way with his dad. Pretty comical when his father keeps dismissing it. He must be thinking ""who do you think you are?""  Aw when Gwen went down the rooftop and Miles put his head down.. I personally felt that. For sure almost cried. I found it cute that they were both seemingly jealous about another potential mate.The first plot twist when all the Spider people appeared around the group while Miles was talking.. about how everyone had the power to reverse a tragic loss, but understandable that they had to let things be to not disrupt the canon events. That was such a tense scene. I really liked that Spider B Parker came back and is still trying to mentor Miles like a father figure. From his introduction, he noticed he definetly went through a character development to being more happy and laid back. Having a kid for sure changed him for the better as a person.  That second plot twist when Miles went to the wrong universe to find his uncle is the one alive and not his dad. With that color scheme, it's almost something out of a Telltale game like ""The Wolf Among Us!"" That final cliffhanger with Miles as the Prowler was nothing but amazing. Such a great film. That 'glitchy' soundtrack is still there and fire!"
1,7,What a film. For a spider geek like myself it hit so many amazing points it was just everything. Off for a cup of chai tea to celebrate how good it was
1,7,"Miles from Earth-42 is the coolest fucking villain I've seen in a long while. With the way it ended, it sucks that we may have to wait until '25 to get the third film (not unless Sony hires a fuck-ton of animators to meet a 2024 release)."
1,7,"Overall I liked it, but it’s got some issues for me.First of all, the audio mixing in many areas was just straight-up bad. I missed so many lines simply because I couldn’t hear it over the music + action.While the colors and styles are great, it’s way too much. Spider-Punk and vulture were hard to keep track of. And I found Gwen’s scenes way too much and too blatant (She sad, so make da room bloo.) It took away from what should be really impactful scenes. Something like Wolfwalkers handled these kinds of backgrounds much better imo. I know my dad will hate this movie’s animation because he already didn’t like the first’s that much (he doesn’t care for the CG/2D, heavy stylization mix showing up more and more.) And this is Into’s animation on copious amounts of coke.A lot of the action was also hard to keep track of. Especially in fight scenes or when introducing new characters. At times it makes it hard to tell what’s happening or where my eye’s supposed to hang out. And a lot of the fight choreography felt sloppy/rushed because of it. Like, in Mile’s first fight with Spot a swan gets involved somehow and I have no clue where it came from despite keeping my eyes on the screen the whole time. There are moments where the audience needs to rest or reorientate but the movie doesn’t provide them.Which brings me to my next point: the story’s pacing is _really_ off. It switches from “way to fast” to “snail’s pace. While I loved the visuals of it, most of the time at the rooftop party could’ve been cut completely to give us more time with Pavtir (who just disappears in the last half of the movie) and/or Hobie, or even to just add a bit more breathing room for fight scenes.Or even to further flesh out Gwen’s arc. which honestly feels so half-baked compared to Miles’ in the first one. I get the argument that this is supposed to be Gwen’s movie. But, there’s so much focus on Miles that it really doesn’t feel like it.Finally, this movie really struggles with “middle-of-the-trilogy” syndrome where it just feels like connective tissue so Into and Beyond make sense. (I’ve seen this a lot in books where the middle one is kinda necessary but you overall feel like you wasted your time.) Part of it is because it doesn’t feel as tightly written as Into, but also because it just introduces a bunch of stuff without really doing anything with them while also ending on that massive cliffhanger. I honestly don’t see myself rewatching this one over-and-over like I have with Into the Spiderverse. Imo, even if you’re making a trilogy, each movie/book should work as a self-contained story that weaves itself into the greater whole.In conclusion: I did like this movie, but it’s got some significant flaws that drag the experience down quite a bit for me. I feel like it’s been greatly overhyped."
1,6,"I'm someone who is just, like, so goddamn sick of superhero movies. I know that's not a common opinion around these parts, especially not for anyone who went to see this movie. But I saw Into the Spiderverse and thought it was quite good, and the reviews were excellent also, so even though I have had it up to my fucking ears in superhero movies, I decided to give this a go.And HOLY. FUCKING. SHIT. What a fucking incredible movie. I think it might be the best animated movie I've ever seen.What I loved about it was that they clearly made this movie for the fun and thrill of making movies. Everything was just endlessly creative and inventive, from the incredibly dynamic art style to the witty dialogue and the cleverly plotted storyline that still made the whole multiverse concept feel fresh rather than beaten to death like it is in the MCU already...it must have been a tremendous joy to be involved in making that film, and it was just as much a joy for me to watch it too.A very interesting choice to have the art at Gwen's apartment so secondary, making the interaction between her and her dad become the greater point of emphasis. I love how the colors ran during the latter part of the movie when she returned home, like a symbol of how the structure of her life is starting to fall apart and remake itself somehow. When a movie starts doing these little things behind the scenes to enhance the storytelling like that, you know you've got a really amazing movie on your hands.And yes, I'll go ahead and say it: it's refreshing to see a movie with a black lead and a black family and have that be completely normalized and not be patting themselves on the back for having a diverse lead for their movie either. It's just nice to see.For real, what's an animated movie that's better than this? The Lion King? Eh, that's a movie for kids! This is a movie for EVERYBODY goddamnit!The next movie I plan on seeing is Mission Impossible so that's going to be two movies in a row where the movie doesn't actually end lol"
1,107,6/10I liked where the story was heading but felt it was drawn out. Didn't know until the end that it was a cash grab cliffhanger movie so that's why it was drawn out. I don't mind story that gets split but don't feel what we got in this part was satisfying enough. What was the climax?  The stupid chase scene where it showed how ridiculous the the other spider-men were?Loved the cameo from all source materials but wish they did more than just one liners or background characters. Loved Gwen and Mile's characters. Don't know if we're suppose to sympathize with Miguel but he's just annoying on screen. Peter B is still great. I'd love a movie with Peter B and May.Beautiful movie but I'd just wait until next year and watch both movies at the same time.
1,60,"I have nothing against ""part 1"" movies. Some of my favorite movies are just ""part one"". Or two of three. What I didn't like was how the end of this otherwise fantastic movie just completely negates any of the earned emotional payoff it was building towards. Yeah it's cool how he built up the courage to finally tell someone he's Spider-Man. But then it just doesn't matter. I feel like they could have handled it being the first of two movies in a much cleaner way. Give him some emotional payoff, and then the sequel hook. Don't go and fake out the audience like that. It's a little cruel and cheapens the whole ending of the movie for me. Especially after how well they handled Gwen right before it.Otherwise I think it's a solid 4/5. A great sequel that builds on what made the original great, with tons of fun dialogue, references, and character building moments. It's just such a shame that they had to structure the two-parter cliffhanger in this way. Compare it to, say, The Empire Strikes Back or even The Matrix Reloaded. Both don't finish the story, both obviously set up sequels. They feel so much better realized in that department however. They feel relatively respectful of the audience and give them something that surprises them, but doesn't feel too cheap. Well maybe someone feels that way about Reloaded but I remember liking that movie's ending quite a bit in spite of the cliffhanger. Anyway.Yeah it's good. Also I don't really like the whole ""lol guess those people are not true fans for not knowing it was a two-parter"" vibe I'm getting from some of these comments. Some of you need to grow up."
1,52,thought the movie was joking when it endedIt's 180 minutes long and ends with a to be continued what feels like 20 minutes from the typical ending where a villain shoots a laser into the skyRoughly 100 minutes are the most cliche scenes imaginable of parent and kid struggling to connect repeated over and over.Some way better animation than the first but man what a time waster of a film
1,13,I can go for a chai tea after this movie
1,13,I saw Into the Spider-Verse 12 times in theaters. I wish I saw it more. It’s my favorite movie of all time indisputably. This film fucking rocks. The Marvel equivalent to the jump between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Absolutely incredible. Spider-Verse is actually gonna end up as one of the best film trilogies **period** and I’m so happy I live in the universe where this is reality.
1,77,"Hella mid compared to the first one, people who say that this was better than the first one are fucking capping so hard"
1,5,"The cinema I was in applauded at the end. We're in the UK, that does not happen."
1,6,"The implication that most Spider-Man universes don't actually have other heroes is interesting.NY being a hellscape in Earth 42 because there's no Spider-Man means there probably also isn't a Luke Cage, Daredevil, etc."
1,7,"Call me crazy, but does the scene where Gwen and Miles investigate the crime scene and keep saying “shoot” meant to emulate the scene from the Wire where McNulty and Bunk kept saying only the f word while investigating their crime scene?https://youtu.be/V_jxgEOdsHc"
1,5,So are canon events basically nexus points now?
1,7,Lego Spider-Man got the pop from my kids. I freaked at the lady from Venom.
1,8,"Miguel says that Miles is the original anomaly, which may be a fair accusation from Miguel’s POV. But if he was in fact an anomaly and “never meant to be Spider-Man”, why does it matter if Miles story has canon moments? It feels like Miguel doesn’t want Miles to be Spider-Man but at the same time wants him to be."
1,5,i love new girl so much. so everytime dad peter came on i could only hear nick lmaooo
1,7,I love how the spider woman on a wheel-chair was actually voiced with a woman in a wheel-chair. https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7211408/?ref\_=ttfc\_fc\_cl\_t38
1,5,Ey yo alot of them spiderwomen were mad thicc no cap
1,7,"semi coherent thoughts about Miles's character writing:I remember seeing the official poster for this months back and thinking, ""cool, but kind of a bummer that Miles's story always needs to share so much screen space with other spider-people"". Except, that's the biggest non issue because they keep using the multiverse as a fantastic narrative tool for Miles's character growth. The first movie used all these spider-people to help Miles become Spider-Man, the second one's entering metanarrative territory wherein it's using the history of Spider-Man as a character to explore what type of Spider-Man does Miles get to be. How much of an original can you be when there are versions out there who've lost entire universes for being *too* different? (which is in a way culminating into that old question of 'exactly how miserable does Spider-Man need to be'). The spider-people in this one are also not helping him realize his potential, for the large part they're in fact holding him back (the space elevator chase I felt was a parallel to the leap of faith scene from the first one, except this time he makes that jump for himself, not for the mask) — Spider-Man The Character's narrative expectations are holding him back. They've already told this story so many times and you think you know the rest, so how do you make Miles stand out? You maybe let him break the canon (how exactly, idk. but Beyond is definitely going there). You let him spread his wings. There's a blank page waiting on that guidance counselor's desk back at Visions Academy and Miles will return and fill it out himself."
1,5,The cold open set the tone SO WELL. The way that the argument between Gwen and her dad was animated to illustrate their conflict was a great preview of what was to come because I don't think anyone can deny that this was visually stimulating and a masterpiece in that regard.
1,7,"haven’t seen this pointed out yet, but Ganke is playing the PS4 Spider-Man game while Miles is getting ready for his Dad’s party"
1,6,"How about he jokes that both Spider-Punk and Peter B. said, ""What's with the uniform, is he bleeding from his armpits?"" hahaha."
1,5,"Inject Spider-Punk into my veins, I need more of him"
1,5,The animation went absolutely insane I can see why it took three years
1,5,"I thought it was very okay. Really loved the start with the vulture and his music and all - lost me a little as it went on. I’m just not huge on big multiverse plots and and cliffhanger ending was insane imo. Just didn’t feel like it fit.Very good art, music, and jokes as always though. The little Lego segment with goofy little Lego spiderman being “one of our best” made me laugh."
1,6,"Anyone else catch the foreshadow when Rio asks Miles ""What happened to your hair?"" when she first sees him in Earth-42?Edit: spelling"
1,6,Genke and Miles' relationship was a special spot in the movie for me. Genke wanting nothing to do with the Spidey stuff even though he's obviously a fan just makes me smile.
1,6,My favourite part was when they recreated the spiderman pointing meme.
1,6,"Would rank this a 9.75 out of 10. Ground-breaking animation and brilliant storytelling. Let out audible gasps when the Spider-Society was introduced, when Miles finds out he's in the wrong universe, and the reveal of Earth-42 Miles being Prowler. My only grip was that they didn't finish the climactic fight before the cliffhanger and now we have to wait a year to see what happens next.Someone at my screening yelled ""THAT'S ITTTTT!?!?!?!"" at the end and honestly that was me internally."
1,7,"This is easily a top-3 Spidey movie of all time. Words cannot describe how **good** the animation is, it's stunning, gorgeous, sublime, breathtaking... and the story is so good - it's fun but sprinkled with tragedy. They put so much love into this film and it shows. Daniel Pemberton's score is even better (which was already great in Into the Spider-verse) this time around and it's sooooo gooood! Also, Spider-Gwen rocks, and my future wife Hailee Steinfeld kills it with her performance (everybody had great performances, actually). I hope we get a Spider-Gwen game like Imsoniac's Spidey one day.I read that there was a cliffhanger so as soon as Miles escaped from Miguel I thought that it was gonna end there, so I'm grateful that they took the time to set up what was gonna come next.I **loved** this movie, man. Best film of the year to me so far"
1,7,Work of art. Truly.
1,5,troy and abed in animmaaaaaaation
1,7,"I really loved this movie, all the small details in the movie, you could tell that they put a lot of effort in making this movie. The animation is god tier and so is the writing. Small details such as the colour changes, artstyle changes, minor call backs to the previous movie like the joke about miles not knowing about comicon, and i loved the whole indian spiderman thing. The indian spiderman was really well done, i thought it would be just for americans but i was amazed to see references that only south asians would get like the zomato board (more like a in movie sponsorship ig), being angry about chai tea and naan bread, mentioning the british stealing things and the joke about indian gwen’s dad thanking miles as if he was helped him with moving things rather than saving his life (no matter what you do south asian parents will always thank you like that lol)"
1,6,"First movie that got me to watch it 3 times, 4th times incoming in next few days"
1,6,"That was an amazing film. Will require multiple re-watches before the next one comes out. Fantastic soundtrack and probably the best visuals I've seen ever, the film really followed the rule of cool and I loved that. Would have happily sat there for another 2+ hours to watch the story wrap up.    Was hilarious at the end when everyone in the Cinema was staring at the screen like ""what!"" when it ended (myself included)."
1,6,my ADHD was pleased
1,5,"I think Miguel could have gotten Miles on his side if he had let Peter B talk to him from the start, because when they were alone, Miles was almost convinced until the other spiders showed up. I know Miguel was trying to be sympathetic, but god, he just fails miserably at it."
1,7,I am madly in love with punk rock spiderman. First I figured yeah hes just gonna be a cool character with a neat shtick. But the shit he did to shake up the establishment. To really fuck with the system. Holy fuck he really was a true punk rock anarchist.
1,8,"Going to be honest Sony is the type of company that can produce stinkers, but then put out amazing movies like this one. It boggles my mind. 10/10 movie"
1,5,"Just watched it for the second time today and still loved it. I just realized that while Miles - 42 is approaching Miles 1610 while he's strapped to the punching bag, you can hear JJJ on the news talking about the sinister 6. Maybe even though this Miles is the prowler, he isn't really a ""bad"" guy with the other villains still being prominent. I'm curious how the sinister 6 will play a role in the next movie. I can't wait"
1,6,"Saw the movie twice. In both instances at the cliff hanger ending people in the crowd shouted in dismay including expletives. First one was a bunch of young women in their 20s I'm guessing.""I have to wait 5 fing years for the next one???"""
1,6,"I swear a few hours ago this sub had a post of an article about how apparently the movie was hell to work on for the animators, but I can't find it now. Was it deleted for some reason?"
1,6,"Did anyone catch that reference to ""The Wire""? When Gwen uses her new powers from the watch to ""show her what happened"" in the lab with spot, her and miles only say ""shoot"" which is basically the same as the scene where Bunk and McNulty examine a crime scene and figure out what the shooter did"
1,5,Broken record time. Perfect. Can't gush enough. Everything was amazing. Potentially the greatest comic book movie ever. Just unreal.  ...BUT...we can't close this trilogy out without an appearance from Christopher Daniel Barnes as animated '90s Spidey. Right?
1,6,"The movie was a lot of fun for most of the runtime and of course it's visually stunning just like the first movie. The shot of them sitting upside down with upside down New York in the background was incredible.However I feel like the movie could have spent much longer on the cutting room floor. Scenes started to repeat a lot, especially with Miles' family trouble, which were already retreading the first movie. A lot of the plot was set up for the next movie which made it quite tedious once it became obvious this is just part 1.I enjoyed it still but I prefer the first one for its smaller scale and restraint in comparison to this. Maybe I'll change my mind once part 2 comes out though."
1,5,"This movie was so damn sick, the credits song was cherry on top.Beautiful Animation beautiful music amazing story, WHY CLIFFHANGER!!!!!!"
1,19,You guys might think I'm crazy but I think this is arguably the best Spider-Man movie yet
1,53,"Because Miles isn’t the Spider-Man, wouldn’t his father dying not destroy the canon? Earth 42 never had a Spidey, so there’s no canon there. I’m calling it. Edited to make it more clear"
1,24,"Honestly felt like they tried to cram a little too much in. Fantastic movie, gorgeous art and cinematography, but the audio was a bit cluttered at my theater. Did anyone else have trouble understanding Gwen during the intro? I could barely hear a thing. Almost looked like parts of the movie were the 3D roll as well. Maybe my theater just sucks."
1,19,"My personal Positives and Negatives for this moviePositives:-Fantastic Visuals-Good character development for Miles and I liked getting more Gwen backstory-Miguel O'Hara was a really cool character and I want to know more about him. I know he's kinda the villain but I really liked him a lot-Very funny dialouge-Any screen time with Peter B Parker is a treasure-Spot guy was amazing and probably my favorite character and I love his 2D animated segments-Lego SpidermanNegatives:-While the movie did have a long run time, there honestly felt like way too much stuff packed into it. There were several locations I wanted to see more of and take my time around it. I felt like the Spidey HQ stuff could have been a majority of the second half. I would have to explore that area and some of the characters a bit more.-Again, while the Visuals were stunning as usual, it did get a bit overwhelming at times, so it was hard to see what was going on. I like Spider Punks newspaper/sketchy quality, but it was a bit distracting that there were so many color flashes in scenes where it was just them talking. -Same for Gwen's universe. It kinda seemed like there were times where they didn't know what direction they wanted to go with it. In the scenes where she's arguing with her father there were many shots where the entire color palette would change on a whim, which looks cool in some shots but seemed unfocused in others-Some of the action scenes needed to be tightened. There was often so much happening on the screen with many different color effects that it was hard to follow what was going on. Also the editing seemed a bit weird in some places-Not sure if it was my theaters fault but the voices were very low in some scenes, especially the opening monolog. Also characters talked over each other a lot which made it hard to understand some jokes.-Finally this is just my own weird opinion but for a movie that heavily focuses on family and the struggles of parenting,.its kinda weird that Peter B took his small BABY into many life threatening situations and Pregnant Spider woman definitely should not have been in the field if she was that far along. I know its a cartoon but stillMaybe I'm just a killjoy or maybe I just need to see the movie again.......but I did not enjoy this one as much as the last one. I did like it, I had fun watching the cameos and seeing the different art styles, but overall it fell flat to me in many aspects"

1,17,Ngl this felt really all over the place for me. Nowhere near as tight as the first
1,15,"Okay, now that I let it sink in a bit, I had several issues with this movie. Keep in mind the first movie is one of my most favorite movies of all time and basically my second favorite animated movie behind Inside Out.The first half suffered from serious pacing issues. There was about 45 minutes of family drama, followed by a 30 minute or so sequence in India where proper stakes of the movie still havnt been properly established, and then another 20 minutes in the Spider Society before the movie really gets going. I think the movie lacked focus and it makes for a lack of story structure. I get this is a Part 1 but you still need a beginning middle and end. Infinity War is a perfect example of giving you a movie that stands on its own and as a Part 1. This movie gave us a beginning, with bits and pieces of a middle and bits and pieces of an end (kind of?).This is gonna sound like absolute blasphemy but I also think the visuals and easter eggs were a little over-indulgent. It felt like the movie knew it was taking a while to get to the point so it spammed beautiful and colorful visuals and cameos at you to help ease the wait. The first struck a balance of insane visuals but letting you sink your teeth into the story that i think this movie really lacked.The good? A lot of the incredible visuals DID work. The voice acting and soundtrack were phenomenal, Miles remains an endearing character that I will root for every day of the week and I thoroughly enjoyed the meta message that Spiderman stories should be allowed to divert from their canon and create something new (didnt catch that until I came on reddit I will admit). I still liked the movie, but I am disappointed. Hoping Part 2 elevates things a bit"
1,23,"My mind was blown by how Marvel/Sony beat DC to the punch. The Flash now has an almost identical story to this movie- even down to ""if my loved one lives in your universe, then I need to be a part of it."" I was so drunk on Easter eggs in this film that by the time the story was laid out my head was missing."
1,52,"SUPER dissapointed about the ending! Why tf did they not advertise this was a PART ONE of a series of movies? The open ending was super unsatisfying, especially since it was a great movie, but at least let people know they're paying for half a product! Like WTF!"
1,30,"The ending kinda ruined it for me. I loved everything until the end, and the more I think about it and the worse it gets. People have brought up Infinity War or Empire or Dune, and all those movies can stand on their own. They gave some closure to certain arcs. This just end mid-movie. It's so baffling!I understand the script ran long, but move pieces around once you decide to make 2 movies out of it, so that part 1 can somehow stand on its own. Fast X pulled the same shit, and while that was a bad movie all around, at least it had a set piece to finish the movie. Across the Spider-verse didn't even give us that! >!They even teased us with the new villains and the amazing punch by his uncle... and then it ends there... a superhero movie ending just before a fight, fucking baffling man!!<It seems we are in the minority, but I still don't get that its being praised so much more than the first one. Not only for the story, but also the animation was a bit more coherent and restrained in the first, while still being amazing and over-the-top. Here it seems they have leaned a bit too much on the fever dream part. Still loved it though, my main problem is the non-ending."
1,34,anyone else think its no where near as gd as the first?
1,43,"I must have been in a bad mood.To start I could barely hear the voices for everything in the spider Gwen universe. So bad that I complained and the waiter guy (dine in theater) just said ""yeah a lot of people have been saying that, don't worry"" WTH. Everything after the intro and until the end of the Miguel fight was excellent. Although the trope where everyone knows the big secret but refuses to tell the audience and main character and just force you to wait the entire movie is perhaps least favorite. The ""twist"" was so predictable that I was very confused why they drew the reveal out so long. They showed the universe he was going to in big flashy letters so it wasn't even a twist. but then took like 20 minutes before his mom revealed it. It felt like we were running out of movie to have a whole nother fight scene. Add on the fact that we got our checks (normally given right before the end of the movie), and suddenly I realized that the movie wasn't going to even have a conclusion. I was disappointed by this so I just submitted and waited for it to end. But then there were almost a dozen face zoom ins and music climaxes that I thought for sure was going to be the end. Started driving me up the wall. By the end I was fuming. I rewatch the first one regularly because of how tightly knit and cohesive of a movie it is. This felt like a great movie that ended up being too long so they panicked and cut the last 45 minutes and replaced it with some very sloppy hacked together mess. I look forward to the next one, but I doubt I'll ever look back fondly on this one."
1,42,"Way overhyped. The movie was slow, it dragged just so they could sell a third, and then nonstop in moments, lord and miller tried bringing that meta and humor from the Lego movies but it doesn’t work here, it takes the seriousness away. Though I loved the animation and shots, it fell flat on actual story and character advancement."
1,39,"Is the same shit of the trailer but in tedious 2hours…Alot of boring talking and talking and talking with giant heads and infinite city backgrounds…No catchy tunes this time, the plot is too convoluted and the “plottwists” are MCU or indian Soap ópera level of bad.The ending drags for almost half and hour Only to get cut abruplty 5/10"
1,36,"I'm going to get downvoted into oblivion but I disliked this movie.  It was too long and bloated and filled with fan service. They could have easily edited it down by 30-45 minutes.  There's so much exposition and set-up for zero payoff.  The cliff hanger ending was frustrating after sitting through all that dialogue.  And now this movie has just set-up another cinematic universe.  I loved the first movie because it told a self contained story.  This movie was just setting up more movies.  If you can't tell a complete story in three hours you're doing it wrong.  And yes my theater had the same audio issues as everyone else where you couldn't hear half the dialogue anyways.  The whole movie was a muddled garbled mess of swapping who they wanted the main character to be.  If they wanted a Spider Gwen movie just make a Spider Gwen movie, I'd have watched that.  But the constant shuffle between Gwen and Miles just left the entire movie unfocused.  And on a personal note the stupid Spider therapy scene was in bad taste and mocks something many of us who are either in or need therapy.  It wasn't funny it was insulting."
1,9,"I hope it gets nominated. 10/10 for story, animation, originality, script, and pacing. It felt like seeing EEAAO on opening night. Let’s get this one best picture."
1,9,"""This is where the traffic is""""This is where the traffic is""""This is also where the traffic is""""This is where the British stole all our stuff!!""BRUH, PAVITRA PRABHAKAR SPITTING FACTS.As an Indian, legit was so happy seeing Pavitra Prabhakar."
1,5,Honestly this movie could've been great I wouldn't know but cause the dialogue was so low in the mix I could only hear half of it. So I didn't fully understand the stakes or hear the jokes.It honestly ruined the movie for me. I emailed a complaint to my cinema right after.
1,7,Donald Glover as the Prowler is genuinely the last thing I thought I would see
1,6,The ending was such a cock tease 😭😭😭 but it was amazing definitely 9.8/10
1,6,"10000/10. Not just the greatest spider-man movie ever, one of the greatest animated works ever created. Emotional, powerful, beautiful, amazing character depth and realistic relationships. The work they put into the different animation styles was insane.Love how much focus on Miles and his parents’ relationship we got as well as Gwen and her dad. The inclusion of tobey, Andrew and the MCU stuff… and the video game stuff.. everything was just perfect for me.Movie really felt like a comic book brought to life and I love that they had the actual comics that certain storylines and events were borrowed from. The Easter egg video for this is going to be so fun to watch.Metro soundtrack not only lives up to the original, but surpasses it. That ending scene with Gwen putting her own team together and heading into the portal… goosebumps.I need part two NOW."
1,5,Enjoyed it thoroughly. Felt a lot of back to the future part 2 vibes in the final third of the film.
1,5,"One subtle thing I liked about this movie was how Miles and his non-spidey life could meet in the middle with the college conversations about Miles’ struggles with feeling like he belongs in academia. I thought that this was a very clever and modern way to approach the problem of bridging the two sides together. In a movie full of amazing set pieces, I loved the college counselor scenes the most."
1,5,the animation for beyond the spider verse is gonna go crazy.
1,6,It’s gonna be lit when Gwen and Miles finally get together! She says it never ends well for Gwen and Spider Man but since we know now that Miles is an anomaly and exception there’s “always a first time.”
1,6,"I doubt I'll be in the minority with this, but I fucking LOVED this movie&#x200B;First of all, it's difficult ot overstate just how visually gorgeous it is. I was hoping to see it in 3D, but either they didn't format it for 3D or they weren't offering it in my area (San Diego, which would be weird). Either way, just in standard, the art and graphics were stunning. I'd recommend watching it for that alone.&#x200B;The story itself was cohesive, solid, and engaging. I wasn't bored a single minute I was in the theater. There was practically no fluff, and the pacing was better than I've seen in ""superhero"" movies in a while. &#x200B;I don't think the original soundtrack for this one was as good as the first, which is why I think it was used less than the first one was. But that's just my opinion, and it was still good. &#x200B;Was cool to hear Daniel Kaluuya speak in something close to his actual accent in a movie for once LOL. And his character was the lowkey MVP of the film. Hoping he makes an appearance in ""Beyond""&#x200B;All in all, I have nothing bad to say about this film. Maybe I will after some reflection nd nitpicking. But for now, easy 10/10, and I don't just throw those around on my amateur ratings either. This was honestly a GOOD film, and I cannot recommend it enough. Easily the most fun I've had in a theater thus far this year."
1,5,I absolutely loved I don’t mind the year wait (compared to what? 4 years?) although I was dying to see Noir and the tease got me bad! This could potentially be such an incredible trilogy like really up there! One thing I’m worried about and hope they don’t do…. is I’ve been seeing people mention for beyond that they think it’ll end and connect in to the MCU/Live Action. I really don’t want them trying to do this ruining how good these movies are. Not saying there shouldn’t be a live action Miles but….
1,5,J Jonah Jameson is a nexus being
1,6,"Very surprised that it was even better than the first one, with greater emotional heft, characters relationships, better villains and a wonderful and inspiring narrative. Hands down the best two superhero movies I've seen since the first two Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies."
1,5,"Can we just talk about how beautifully the family dynamics are portrayed in this film? Damn.Miles’s balcony scene with his mom and Gwen’s resolution scene with her dad; to me, these were at the heart of the movie.Really nice stuff with Peter as a father, too. Gwen’s dad talking about “this parenting stuff is a big mystery,” that line felt like a real wonderful underpinning for how parenting functions in this film."
1,5,Miles Immorales was a great reveal
1,7,"I feel horrible for miles. In a way, all the friends he made from the other universes betrayed him. They all knew the truth and kept it from him AND not only went along with miguel's plan for a while but didn't do much to back him up. They just stood there during his ""intervention"" Or at least that's probably how he sees it. I'm glad gwen rounded up some like-minded spiders to try and do the right thing but my heart broke when Miles broke the tether that Gwen threw when she tried to catch him. A metaphor for broken trust"
1,6,I loved how when Miguel was talking about canon moments it straight up showed the cover to the wedding issue. We needed that middle finger to Marvel during this “Paul” disaster lol
1,6,"Did anyone else notice the metaphor using the cakes at the beginning of the movie? ""You can't have your cake and eat it too."" ""But not if you have two cakes."" Feel like this will be important later!"
1,5,"Guess this is a hot take but I thought the first one was better. Don’t get me wrong, still thoroughly enjoyed this one but it was also a little bloated, soundtrack wasn’t as good & didn’t balance the emotional/dramatic scenes with comedy as well as Into the SV did. Still very excited for Beyond though. Also just give me a separate Spider-Man 2099 movie in this animation style"
1,6,When Miles and Gwen are investigating the crime scene caused by Spot exploding and they keep saying “Shoot.”  Tell me that wasn’t a reference to McNulty and Moreland from The Wire communicating with each other by only saying “fuck”.
1,5,"Beautiful animation, the scene with Miles fleeing from all the other Spider-people was the highlight for me (all the action and jokes thrown into that scene were nuts).&#x200B;I prefer the first movie, though.  I think the Miles story takes just a little too long to get going in this one, and there was a little too much focus on his family drama.  We don't learn about the ""canon events"" plot until a little bit into the second hour, which is where the movie really takes off, until it grinds to a halt in the last 15 minutes for the sake of sequel setup."
1,5,"Absolutely loved the movie except for the sound. Our cinema sounded like it wasRecorded in mono, with all sound coming from the centre front channel. Couldn’t hear a lot of the dialogue and it sounded tin-like and echoey. This was in a Dolby Atmos V-Max cinema"
1,5,"I really enjoyed this for the most part. The animation was absolutely stunning. The first movie looks amazing, but I  think the animators somehow managed to make the visuals for this movie look even greater. I really enjoyed getting to actually see more dimensions, since the first movie was pretty much confined to Miles’s dimension. I liked the way the first movie experimented with different animation styles, but I think this movie blew the first one out of the water in that regard. I also enjoyed the characters a great deal. I liked that Gwen was sort of a co-protagonist alongside Miles. I think Miles’s actions drive a lot of the plot, but the character arc and development was really more focused on Gwen this time around. Gwen reconciling with her father was one of my favorite scenes in the whole movie. Hopefully we’ll get some good resolution on Miles defining what it means to be Spider-Man on his own terms in the next movie. If I had to give one criticism for the movie I think it felt like an incomplete story. I don’t think cliffhangers are a bad thing, but the second half of this movie very much felt like setup for the next movie. It doesn’t really stand on its own as a relatively emotionally complete package. I think how well this movie will hold up very much depends on how well the third movie turns out."
1,5,"It's a very good movie but I am going to mention a few criticisms:-as amazing as the visuals are, a few too many cuts and it's hard to focus a bit in many scenes. I wish I could pause this movie and just admire it-a bit too much happening. They already introduced spot as the big bad, then there's Miguel and then again at the end they introduce yet another one.-overall I think the previous one is a better movie, but can't wait to watch this again"
1,5,"This is a very good movie with masterclass animation. I thought Puss in Boots would have the best animation in a movie I’ve seen for a long time, but this outdid it. The two hour run time felt short too.One thing I will add that doesn’t have to do with the movie itself is that I need to stop seeing anything Marvel on opening weekend. Aside from not being a huge fan of crowds, these movies bring out all the people with zero theater etiquette, which theater etiquette is usually as simple as “sit down and be quiet”. Obviously you can react to jokes and stuff or just whisper little quips you have to your friends, but I was next to a group where someone was flat out responding to lines, using their phone, laughing during obviously serious moments in the movie, and just in general not being respectful of the people around them. Unless you’re like 10 or under, it shouldn’t be hard to just watch the movie and react when everyone else does."
1,5,Feel like I’m the only one that thought Miguel stole the show? God he was awesome
1,5,"My favorite part of the movie is that it is not another villain of the week plot as almost all superhero movies are. It has The Spot, and it even makes a few jokes about him being a “villain of the week”, but the plot isn’t really about him as he is just a small part of a much larger story.I feel that ever since Batman 1989 almost every comic book / superhero movie has had a villain centric plot. Batman ‘89 with The Joker, Batman Returns with Penguin and Catwoman, Batman Forever with Two Face and The Riddler, Batman & Robin with Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy, Raimi Spider-Man with Green Goblin, Spider-Man 2 with Doc Ock, Spider-Man 3 with Hobgoblin, Sandman AND Venom. All of the MCU and DCEU movies and even the Nolan and Reeves Batman movies follow this same formula. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse does with The Kingpin as well.The only comic book movies I can think of that don’t fall into this trap are the X-Men movies as they tend to focus more on the social commentary about mutants and humans trying to coexist together, although they still sometimes follow this formula as well (e.g. X-Men: Apocalypse).It was just so refreshing to see a comic book movie deviate from this formula and deliver a unique and thematic story that didn’t revolve around a villain trying to get revenge or take over / destroy the world.And don’t get me wrong, I still enjoy a story that is villain centric if done well. Avengers Infinity War was amazing and is almost entirely about the villain. But the formula has gotten tired and stale over the decades and I loved that this movie decided to take a risk and do something different."
1,6,"My theory about how the next film will handle the Canon Events issueIt's already been heavily foreshadowed twice in ATS.  So the main thing is that Canon events must happen otherwise the structure of the Spiderverse will collapse and therefore erase a universe, or incursion.  But with that said, we've seen ""events"" gotten prevented twice with the inclusion of *multiple Spider-persons* helping out.  The helicopter save in Spider-Gwen's universe and holding up of a building in Mubahattan.  Of course it showed that multiple Spider-People came to fix the hole that threatened to swallow up the universe.  But that is the point.  What do Spiders Build?  Webs...they build the web, they write the story....not the other way around.  Miguel is so concerned about the shape of the web, he isn't thinking how he could build a new one, a stronger one.  Obviously he cannot do it alone...he hasn't been doing it alone.  But looking at how the Spider-people had helped with saving people from death in the two events, by combining the webs and building something stronger than a helicopter or a an entire science building, who's to say that they cannot use their abilities to build a stronger web for the Spiderverse?  If there is a weakness in the web because of a lack of a canon event, then we just need more Spiders to build webs to hold that part together."
1,5,Probably the best movie I've seen in theaters in a while. Didn't see it on IMAX but >!definitely will for part 2!<
1,6,Did anyone else cry when Miles’ mom said: I worry they won’t root for you like we do.Relatable!As the Keenan Ivory Wayne’s would say: MESSAGE
1,5,That was so fucking good
0,5,"Question. At the end of into the spiderverse, Gwen calls out to miles. That scene was mirrored in across the spiderverse, but miles is wearing different clothes, listening to something different as well. are they supposed to be the same scene?"
1,5,Anyone else catch the joke about miles being in the horse? Was it a reference to the first ever recorded ‘movie’ or am I tripping
1,5,"There is SO much to talk about with such a fantastic film, and a lot has already been said here but I will add this- A plot twist I think would be insane to see is if Peter Parker is like some sort of evil genius in universe 42 and the Prowler Miles is actually a hero?!? We are missing so much context around Prowler and Uncle Aaron and I can’t help but think it’s for a reason… maybe I’m asking for too much but am I alone in thinking that would absolutely sick??"
0,5,Was Spider-Punk in Gwen's team at the end?
1,5,"Love how similar to Spider-Man 2 that starts and ends on a shot of Mary Jane, this starts and ends on Gwen Stacy. Though also love that, unlike Spider-Man 2, she bookends it with narration and the drum theme."
1,6,Miguel’s AI lady has got it goin on
1,5,Very “James Bond - like” ending credits which was cool when the movie is already fully animated
1,5,"loved it as well, so much heart, awesome fight and action animation, beautiful art style and its wild how they mix so much different art styles and abstract backgrounds and it just works because the whole thing is like one moving comicbook. That cliffhanger ending was painful man but damn what a setup.   Loved the mumbai-hattan? world, fun concept. Loved all the action scenes with the Spot, they mustve  had so much fun choreographing all those portal attacks/gag and it felt like you could barely keep up with the zaniness."
1,5,"Will def need to watch it again but...I cannot believe they actually Roger Rabitted Andrew Garfield and Donald Glover into this, like when I watched no way home I was like ""how are they ever gonna top this?"" Well they did something alright"
0,5,"I have some questions. Does every Spidey in the Spider Society know about their future canon events? If so, are they just sitting around waiting for those events to happen? Kind of out of character for them. If the usual time theory is correct, not actively participating in the canon events should also alter the timeline, which sounds risky. This brings me to my next question.If Cap Morales is supposed to die, he should die regardless of Miles being there, as long as no other Spider-Men interferes the event (eg: Captain Singh's event). In every other canon event, the respective Spider-Men have actively participated in trying to save the victims. Why was Miles being stopped from saving his dad?"
1,5,"What a phenomenal film. Spoilers for Logan (2017)I was dreading that Miles' confession to his ""mom"" revealing himself to being Spider-Man was paralleled to Xavier's when he shares with ""Logan"" feeling like he didn't deserve ""the most perfect night I've had in a very long time,"" and then the clone of Logan kills him.It was a really tense moment that dragged, in a phenomenal film-making way, when the parallel clicked for me and Miles kept on talking. I was so scared for him and kept looking over his shoulder, waiting for him to get attacked through the window."
1,6,"At first, I didn't like that they merged live-action and animated stuff together, it kind of broke my immersion a bit but when i thought about it a little bit more it was a natural extension of mixing these multiple styles together. nice way of making people think that a spider-verse story is happening right now in another universe and its in a animated form. Like each universe of the spider-verse is its own animated style so ours would be an live action one."
1,6,"Just watched it a second time today with my nephew. He loved it and won't stop quoting Spider-punk.I noticed more things to appreciate in this movie, and dislike a bit compared to the first.In the first there's more static scenes that hold on a scene, while this one is quite full and active. That's not a bad thing since it was just absolutely amazing.Compared to the first movie, this one has more on-screen action and personality. For my eyes, a bit too much to look around at.The music seemed louder too. First time watching I didn't have a problem hearing the characters talking, but this time I felt like I could barely hear what was said, but, my nephew had no problems. I had a greater appreciation for the Villains in this movie.Spot really came off as a victim. I mean he is. He lost so much because of the Spiderverse, and he hasn't even hurt anyone.Miguel was badass, and seemed different. He can't wall crawl, can he? I noticed he wallcrawled with his claws instead of sticking to things.The end villain reveals were intimidating. Scarier than compared to their counterparts.I'm stoked for a third film."
1,5,How are the Peter Parkers okay with Miguel O Hara's plans?
1,5,THE COLLECTIVE EXCITEMENT WHEN DONALD GLOVER SHOWED UP !!!! I love him
1,6,Indian Spiderman won my heart with Chai tea rant. Too relatable 😭🤌🏼
1,5,"I'm not very good at noticing things but I knew the minute he stepped into the ""GO Home"" machine, he's going to Earth 42.I was super proud of myself ngl"
1,6,So just rewatched it with the improved audio that Sony sent to theaters and it definitely helped with hearing Gwen in the beginning and Spider-Punk overall. Loved this movie just as much the second time around. The animation is just so fucking good.
1,5,"I can't wait for Nik Cage for the third movie.Absolutely loved this movie. Really good. Very emotional and good soundtrack. Also, I loved it has it's own identity and didn't fall back on the first movie. Great all-time movie sequels."
1,6,"When Gwen steals Scarlet Spider's watch and crushes it in her hand, she's visibly confirming her rejection of the Spider Society and Miguel's indoctrination.She still has a long way to go to repair the damage she did to her friendship with Miles and to his heart. But at least she's started.And though I understand that Miles has every reason to be furious with her, I hope he eventually sees how genuinely she desires to make things right with him. Calls to mind The Last of Us Part 2, when >!Ellie tells Joel that she doesn't think she can ever forgive him, but would like to try.!<"
1,5,"Did anyone think the Spider-Men were a little out of charcter? Spider-Man is a character that saves everyone he can, and always finds a way to do so, or try. Seeing the Spider-Men being willing to let people die for the sake of being a ""canon event"" was odd."
1,5,Loved it
0,5,is indian spiderman... dopinder from Deadpool?
1,5,The beautiful shots of the New York skyline and the scenes in the bodega made me very nostalgic of NYC… they really captured the city very well.I also loved the concept of Mumbattan and the Brooklyn Bridge design from it.
1,5,"That movie was *phenomenal*. Never been so tempted to buy a ticket for a 2nd showing to see what I missed. Lost track of the amount of Spidies I recognized.Did not think they could make a sequel as good as the first one because it was that good, but holy hell they pulled it off. Gorgeous across the board."
1,5,I just got out of my theater. This has to have been the most serious super hero movie I've ever seen. I was constantly tearing up at the dialogue and being amazed by the visuals.
1,5,"I absolutely loved this movie, like a 10/10… until the end! It just kinda ended, it was building up to this big conclusion all movie and then it just ends without any resolution. I know they’re saving it for the third, but I felt a little burned that the main plot of the film didn’t resolve."
1,5,"They apparently couldn't find a way to translate ""Shoot"", so in the German version there was like five minutes of Gwen and Miles just standing around saying ""SHIT"" over and over and I love it"
1,6,I was sort of bored the whole time. Idk why. I loved the first one.
1,5,Rewatched it today. I am literally obsessed with that movie it’s amazing
1,5,Uhm did anyone else see that dumpity dump truck on Miguel?
1,5,"I think people have said plenty. It is an amazing movie. If they finish with the last movie on top, there is a great contender for best movie trilogy. Of the 2 hours and 20 minutes runtime I was not bored for a single second, despite there being so many story lines to follow. And the humor is great as well. I was cackling to myself so many times. GREAAAAAT MOVIIIIIEEEEEE"
1,5,I immediately noticed that Miles’ mom’s eye color was green (instead of brown) when he entered Earth-42 and I knew something was wrong. What a good detail!
1,5,"I just saw the movie. Best animation ever.It's what is for any Super-hero animation movie what ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is for Star Wars.I cannot stop looplistening the last tune."
1,6,I know I am one of the last people to the party but holy hell I audibly screamed when the credits rolled I did not know it was ending I was so enthralled I didn't even realize how much time had passed I thought there was another hour+ of the movie left oh my god. What a fucking perfect first part.
1,5,"Although the movie had some cool moments, it  failed to catch my attention like its predecessor. I was disappointed in it and I liked the first movie better."
1,13,"This is very much a minority opinion so I just want to connect with a few people here who might have had the same qualms with the movie as me. From a technical and audio-visual standpoint this movie is absolutely mind-blowing. Every frame is gorgeous and the sheer level of technical and artistic skill on display is staggering and that alone sets this movie miles(hehe) ahead of anything else in the comic book genre. And thats what will keep me coming back to this film.  (\*\*\*Spoilers ahead\*\*\*)But I do think there is one huge aspect that soured the experience for me: The fact that this is half a movie. Maybe I was a bit aloof to some of the promotional material of the film but I had no clue that this is was supposed to be the Part 1 of 2 movies. I really wish I had known this was the case so that I would then have been able to better with the movie conscious that things wouldn't be resolved. But fundamentally I don't think this needed to be split up into two movies, especially in the way that it was done. It's 2023 and the movie industry is no stranger to two-parter films, but such two-parters usually come at the end of a series of films, ala Marvel's Infinity War and Endgame, the last two Harry Potter films and even the mindless Fast and Furious films. While each of these have been successful to varying degrees, my position is that they as such 'earn' the two-parter by creating blockbuster after blockbuster movie that fleshes out the universe that they are creating to a good degree before diving into the two-parter. But this is absolutely not the case with the movie. I feel like the second movie in this Spiderverse series should have been a complete chapter that put our characters through new trials and tribulations but also resolved them and closed out most loops by the end, much the way the first film(which is an absolute masterpiece imo) did. Instead I found the movie to be extremely unsatisfying to the point that it reduced my enjoyment of what came before. This half-a-movie syndrome is what most affected my enjoyment of the film, but aggravated a few other aspects that I did not like as much. Aside from the beautiful heart-to-heart between Miles and his mother early on, it sort of became clear retroactively that scenes were being dragged on with the kind of quippy humour we associate with Lord and Miller productions to pad the runtime. Later on just as The Spot becomes a formidable villain he suddenly disappears, so that now more than halfway through this movie the Spider-people society can be introduced and quickly revealed to be new antagonists to Miles' spiderman. In the last few minutes, there is the amazing reveal that Miles is in an alternate universe captured by a prowler version of himself, which while interesting, happens too late to meaningfully contribute to this story, leaving all the good stuff with regard to this scenario for the next film. Because of all this it felt unsatisfying. This is surprising because even when franchises do opt for two-parters there is some semblance of chapter-wise breakdown of the overall story that makes each half amazing but this movie spends so much time delaying its actual plot and introduces new antagonists later and later into its runtime that it ultimately only promises the next great film instead of being one. While all the above has to do with Miles, I found Gwen's arc weirdly disappointing in that her father's reversal from wanting to arrest her at the beginning to turning in his badge, was not adequately explored and I do feel they should have spent more time there establishing how that reversal came about. As we see Gwen rounding out her rag-tag team of Spiderpeople at the end, instead of feeling like this was a tight-knit team that had each other's back and will pose a considerable challenge to Miles' foes, it did not sit well with me. The great characters we see in Into The Spiderverse are only revisited at the very end here, which seems like a lost opportunity to have had a few scenes with them early on in this movie as well, so that we see them interact with each other and get the sense that the closing team-up is earned. Because I was surprised how little I enjoyed the overall story of the film I went back to the first film to understand if it was really the same. But instead, the first one is equally beautifully animated and scored, and importantly well-paced and plotted with amazing character interactions, a lot of which while funny, never become the kind of non-stop quippy mess that much of the first half of this second movie reduces to. But clearly most people have enjoyed this film more than the original so most do not share my opinion of the film, so maybe I just did not vibe with my first viewing of this movie. I will try watching it again at a later date and I hope that it ends up being more enjoyable (before the next movie comes out though, because I am still excited for it; hopeful that all these unfinished storylines will be fantastically concluded!)"
1,38,"Just walked out. Collection of random thoughts:--My eyes hurt. Like, literal, physical pain. About the halfway mark I knew it was going to be bad and I had to start closing them for 10-20 seconds every now and then. I'm prone to eye strain, and this was brutal.--Visually, it's the most remarkable movie maybe ... ever? It's also dialed to 11 basically the entire time. And that's a lot.--This feels like a Spider-Gwen movie maybe more than a Miles Morales movie. She has the more interesting storyline (Miles's often feels redundant to the prior entry and also to other Spider-Man films), she's a smarter and more interesting character, and her powerset isn't absurd. Miles is basically the guy from the Infamous video game series, Spider-Man, and also [INSERT INVISIBLE SUPER-HERO HERE]. It feels like he's a walking cheat code a lot of the time.--The imagination and creativity on display is just mind-bending. Every few minutes something else that brought a smile to my face and then something even more amazing would happen, and then they would top it a few minutes later. T-Rex Spider-Man? Bollywood Manhattan? Awesome.--Miguel O'Hara isn't a Spider-Man, is he? They allude to that when they say he isn't funny, and Spider-Man is supposed to be funny. I'm guessing that he's a Man-Spider and the injections are to keep him from turning. I would have liked to have seen more from him because I totally identified with his frustration. They're trying to save worlds and people are bringing children with them, going off-mission and doing random shit, and acting like little jackasses.--I really, really wish they'd made Miles 17 instead of 15. He is too young for the way he's behaving, the storylines they're giving him ... everything. Him being on the cusp of turning 18 and struggling with the transition to college would make so much more sense for that ""what's your future hold"" academic advisor meeting and make the romance and rebellion storylines feel a bit more organic. This was a bit of an issue in the first one, but it's a lot here. There are a few points where he says, ""I'm not a kid,"" ... yeah, you fucking are. You totally are a child. A fifteen year old is a freshman in high school. My son is a freshman in high school, he and all his classmates are children.--Imagine for a moment that they cut the Gwen Stacey intro and instead gave us a kaleidoscopic 60 second flashback during the scene when she reveals that she knew what would happen to Miles's parents. It would have hid her motivation from the audience, cut 15 minutes off a running time that could use some trimming, gotten rid of some pointless action sequences, camouflaged the Miguel reveal until he lowers down on that slow-moving throne thing, and we would have lost nothing. It would have also made it feel more like Miles's film, though maybe they don't mean for it to be.--We could have used a lot fewer scenes of angst with Miles and his parents. So. Many. Repetitive. Angst. Moments. JFC.--The reveal that Miles is in the wrong universe was telegraphed from the beginning and I still didn't see it coming. What a moment. Fucking awesome. The cliffhanger worked like gangbusters for me ... perhaps in part because my eyes couldn't take anymore.--I cannot praise the character design and look of the worlds enough. Phenomenal. Chef's Kiss. The Prowler and Uncle Aaron at the end are a study in lighting and color and framing to create menace in familiar, non-world-shattering-disco-ball environs. The chase scene with the Spider-Men is simply one of the most astounding, unbelievable film sequences of all time.--So, I wasn't the hugest fan of the ""Naw, I'm gonna do my own thing,"" in the first film, and I could have done without them bringing that line back.  It feels flippant given what the character had just learned (frantic desperation seems like it would suit the mood better).--I saw a trailer for an Indiana Jones film starring Harrison Ford and a superhero movie with Michael Keaton as Batman before Across The Spider-verse. I'm twelve again."
1,8,"I think I get what the canon means, it means in Spidey life at least there's 2 tragedy. The loss of the loved one by getting killed (Loss), and the loss of another loved ones by their battle against the enemy (Sacrifice).   \-in Tobey it's his uncle getting shot (Loss) and Harry getting stabbed (sacrifice),\-in Garfield it's Gwen (Loss) and Capt. Stacy (Sacrifice against lizard)\-In Tom, I think it's May (Loss) and MJ (sacrifice (what is getting forgotten if not living death), this is debatable nonetheless (maybe soon in spiderman 4))(Can Tony sacrifice count? Nahhh, not sure bout that)\-In Miles it's his Uncle Aaron death (Loss), and someone close to him sacrificing his lives (His Dad, His Mom, Gwen? Peter B? Spot redemption??? Ganke Lmao?)"
1,9,"I usually don't like when movies plan for a sequel. But in this case it works. I'm going to watch Into the Spiderverse, Across The Spiderverse and then Beyond The Spiderverse back-to-back-to-back.Also, I kind of want to bang Miles' mom."
1,29,"Am I the only one who didn't like this movie?The visuals were amazing, sounds were so on point but, anything else?In terms of narrative and story, what did it tell? They mesmerized us with flawless animations yet they seem like nothing to tell.If it was a couple of short movies that had little connection between them, I could like it. I believe I just watched a 3.5-hour-long trailer which makes no sense at all. Don't we all know to be a Spiderman that requires great sacrifices? Don't we know Spiderman tries to catch their life but couldn't because of the villains on their roads? Don't we know to learn |changing the timeline could cause bad things? What did this movie give me?I don't accept ""it is the first part of the series"", that doesn't give the right of being a video that introduces a bunch of characters in fancy animations.Many scenes don't fit in with the entire movie. Why did I watch the university conflicts between Miles and his family, does that contribute to the movie? The spot was a desperate person who tried to steal an atm from a market and 5 minutes later he became a nemesis of spider man, how come? Just How did you change your ultimate goal to rob a market to becoming a villain by just jumping across a few streets? Why the hell, didn't Miles become invisible while being chased by all the other spiderman? The movie showed that the invisibility of Miles doesn't trigger the spider-sense of Gwen. How logical to webbing to stop|slow down a collapsing building, and try to save people? There must be many casualties yet no one talks about them except the young girl and the sheriff they saved. What is the reason|science or what ever behind of atom collider with Spot? If he needs an energy only, why did he used that?All these make me unable to believe the world they created and can't make me love the movie. I wonder your thoughts and challenge you to make me believe I am wrong."
1,26,"The plot was too meta for my liking. Instead of a Spider-Man movie, we got a movie about spider men spidermenning, IFKWIM. Too many repeated family drama shit. Could have done less of those scenes. Miles’ problem felt like nothing burger and was unable to feel sympathetic. Oh your parents don’t want you to go to Princeton, what a sad life. Oh you want to come out as Spider-Man to your parents, what a tragedy.Compare miles’ problems with what happened to spot. Bro literally fucked up spot’s life and kept joking about it. And didn’t realise what a tragedy that was. Spot was a fun tragic character but they didn’t give him the seriousness it deserved, while they kept showing the family problems of Miles’ as if that is the worst thing that could happen in the spider universe."
1,39,"Anyone else felt like this was originally supposed to be a Disney+ limited series? Each segment was roughly 20 minutes long and felt like a bunch of smaller stories within a larger framework.Edit: Since people seem to think I’m downing the movie and not just pointing out how it’s structured. Ep 1 Catching up with Gwen and seeing her backstory.  Ep 2 Catching up with Miles.  Ep 3 Miles and Gwen catch up in New York.  Ep 4 Miles follows Gwen into Mumbatten.  Ep 5 Gwen takes Miles Into the spider verse… lobby. Miles escapes.  Ep 6 Miles ends up in the wrong universe. Gwen reconciles with her dad. Then assembles the team.  Each segment is roughly 15-20 minutes long. Just like a tv show. And they each have a well defined Beginning, Middle and End.It’s not bad. It’s just different from the typical three act structure of most movies."
1,21,The ending was very unsatisfying. Idc if it’s a two parter. Give some sort of conclusion like infinity war did
1,18,What the actual f+CK how is Hollywood getting away with this bs 2part film without advertising it before hand as a multipart cinematic experience. Cutting off the story right as it was getting to act 3 so anticlimactic. I can't express how furious I am at this.
1,60,"Overall I liked it but for a Spider-Verse movie I was a little put off by their disinterest in honouring the pastSpectacular Spider-Man! …..gets 1 line of dialogueScarlet Spider! …..is a complete jokeSpider-Man ‘67! ….breaks his back?Spider-Man Unlimited! …no linesHopefully the next movie expands on some of this as I have a tough time believing EVERY version of Spider-Man from EVERY Spider-Man cartoon would go along with the “predestination” thing.  For the record I think 2099 is right over Miles but Peter (especially Spectacular!) is such an optimist I feel he’d act the same as Miles. I didn’t like every version of Peter acting like 2099’s chumps. I’m glad they portrayed Peter B. Parker as conflicted and showed that he actually watched the death of a world or else it would have bordered on character assassination.I really like Miles, but you don’t need to beat down every version of Peter to prop him up.It was a great movie for Miles and Gwen though. In fact I thought the stuff between Gwen and Captain Stacy was what hit the hardest emotionally.Also, I’m uncomfortable that Peter is taking his toddler to fights and that Jessica Drew is doing deadly motorcycle stuns pregnant. That kinda stuff lowers the stakes and makes it all seem goofy. The different tones the movie takes on is like an emotional whiplash. Laugh, cry, laugh, cryI did love how they incorporated all the live-action stuff though (Donald Glover!) and scenes like the ASM 90 scene are what this needed more of. I think I’ll like the next one better with the full-spider team back.Animation was spectacular (ha!) as always"

1,18,"-	Art style was obviously turned up to eleven and luckily it worked. I think the mixed art styles helped with that by adding some variety, but even the Studio montage was so damn pretty-	On that note, shout out to Regal for having red ghosting around the top of white objects. Really added to the effects… in all seriousness though it wasn’t noticeable once everything else got rolling so I didn’t really care because everything else looked so damn good. -	I liked the “incomplete drawn “ buildings instead of construction infrastructure on the background skyline. -	In the same vein, The Spot had construction lines showing (idk what those are actually called) until he “Leveled Up”. They were still sometimes visible once was upgraded so maybe that shows he still has a final evolution form-	Miguel also had construction lines showing. Maybe he’s due for another transformation?-	Speaking of Miguel, it wasn’t that surprising that he turned out to be an antagonist considering his suit [actually had a skull on it](https://youtu.be/hn1VxaMEjRU)… but there wasn’t like a big reveal he was going to be the antagonist as if to shock us so it wasn’t annoying. It was a slow ramp up so it worked. -	For a middle part in a trilogy the story was good. I dig the “canon” plot device. Works perfectly with a multiverse concept. Excited to see how they resolve it in the third half. My prediction is something to do with Miles creating a “new canon” -	If they don’t fuck the third one up this will be the best super hero trilogy of all time (please be nice /r/RaimiMemes)-	I’m sure most people will do a better job pointing out the references than I will, so I’ll just say the Lego world would have made me roll my eyes if the writers didn’t have that connection so they get a pass, and Donald Glover cameo gets a pass because I love him -	God it was so beautiful. I know I already said that but I just wanted to say again.-	Hyundai product placements were jarring and stupid. Was that a metaphor for captitalism too? That product placements are stupid? Also I like how B.K. Went out of their way to food dye a burger irl and it doesn’t even match the off color burger they had in the movie. -	EDIT: Forgot to mention I thought of while in the theaters. I liked that they didn’t subtitle the Spanish lines. I didn’t understand most of them as a monolingual, but it worked because it felt like “yeah only bilinguals will get this” and that’s the point Way to go Sony Animation. You did a good job. Please don’t fuck the third one up, and maybe can we get some 1.43:1 scenes for imax?"
1,17,"Man, everyone is so in love with this movie I feel like a wet blanket thinking it was incredibly disappointing.FWIW, the animation was beautiful (loved the different world styles like Renaissance Sketch Vulture, Spider-Punk, etc.) and there were a lot of fun characters (looking at Hobie and The Spot here). I don't want to diminish the amazing work the artists put in this film.But.It was so dense and cluttered with-- convoluted-yet-uninteresting plot points,- too many characters with their own arcs who the movie didn't actually have room to develop,- too much high-concept moral debates that didn't feel grounded in actual tangible events in the story,- too much meta stuff that feels tonally dissonant from what the first movie was like,- too much escalated emotional tension that was so intense but went by too fast to fully land,- disasters like in Pavitr Prabhakar's universe that felt like they should have world-shaking fallout wrt the Breaking Canon stuff but there wasn't enough time to actually see the consequences,- a villain who the story seemed to revolve around without enough interaction and screen presence midway through to keep him feeling relevant, despite being one of the most interesting and engaging characters in the movie,- honestly boring fanservice referencing other movies because MCU corporate culture has infected everything and media can no longer stop being a snake eating its own tail,- a twist at the end that sidelined the entire story AGAIN, with Evil Miles feeling like he belonged in a separate movie with a separate story,- a To Be Continued that didn't need to happen if they just cut out the million complications that derailed the movie in the first place...I dunno, it was a neat movie, but once they started talking about Canon Events I just started to check out a bit. Reminded me of the Homestuck sequel. I felt bad for all the little kids watching the movie who would have *no earthly idea* what was going on halfway through except that Miguel was mean.I dunno! I'm happy for the people who enjoyed this one, but for me too many things dragged it down."
1,29,I'ma post my own review lol l. I'm a comic fan and really enjoyed the 1st one but this felt painfully average.  A 5/10 in my book is a average film. This was a 6/10 just good. It was a popcorn movie similar to the FAST movies.This movie makes no sense. Once it passes to dimensions hopping.ProsThe 1st 45 minutes are *GREAT* Gwen stuff & Miles pre universe jumpingVisuals 10/10Music solidSpot was good.Cameos were good.Cons.We treating Spiderman like a drone now. MF Peter Parker is now letting people die because of fate. Now if your gonna argue well it was actually Miguel ... They still followed him.No other iterations of Miles are anywhere in the film. Which makes no sense since PS4 Peter is here.The pacing after Miles jump is terrible.If this is you're 1st time seeing Miguel. I'm sorry this iteration is terrible. If you like him good for you but as a comic fan this was embarrassing.The jokes are needed because it's a spiderman film. But most didn't land it genuinely felt like children humor which was pretty disappointing because the 1st film was great even though it's jokes didn't work for me they felt more natural. This time around no one in my theater laughed at most of the jokes.Replace Miguel with Superior and I couldve bought his aggression twords miles. I could probably add more but if someone ask I will Elaborate
1,9,Was a great movie until that ending and it drags it down overall for me. It’s a great set up and will work great once part 2 comes out but there is no climax to the movie. After the Spider-Men fight it’s all set up. Miguel is definitely going to be miles rival not the hole guy but I hope prowler miles is evil and they don’t pull some bs out of their ass where it was a misunderstanding. It should of gone the Dune 1 route where they still have the climactic fight but have another major event to end the movie on.
0,10,**NICOLAS CAGE IS BACC BABY !!!**
1,9,"Oscar Isaac was outstanding as Miguel O'Hara.  The anger, despair, frustration with Miles in their last scene together was visceral.Also, great timing releasing this on Pride month.  So many will relate to the difficulty of coming out to their family, and the fear of what will happen if they do."
1,7,"Mixed thoughts on this one. Absolutely beautiful film with some incredible moments and accompanied by an amazing soundtrack. But doesn't live up to the original for me.The 1st was one of my favourite films *ever*, but unfortunately it feels like they've fucked the pacing by splitting the film into 2 parts. I still enjoyed it but it felt too ""meta"" and too all over the place to flesh out anything at all in the story; quite exhausting imo.A few new interesting characters were introduced but character building was poor and mostly consisted of them injecting witty one liners into random scenes, hence why it feels like the film relies on the more interesting characters from the first film.And are we really supposed to believe Miles' managed to escape from thousands of spiderman's (spidermen?) who also have much more experience than him? Plot armour seemed just a *little too strong.*Best parts of it for me was when the story slowed down and kept it in Miles Morales' universe; I loved watching the dynamic between Miles and his parents and Gwen's interactions with them.Its a shame they didn't let this sequel stand on its own two feet like the 1st film and instead relies too much on the 3rd film coming. I don't mind there being a part 2 but it needed a proper conclusion and it could've done it whilst still leaving it on a cliffhanger for the 3rd.*Also did anyone else think the dialogue was too quiet at the start of the film? Audio was weird. And who else noticed his roommate playing the spiderman game, haha.*"
1,8,I'm really interested to see how they handle Prowler Miles. It would be an interesting juxtaposition between Miles being raised by his Father and Miles being raised by his Uncle. I'm intrigued to see where it goes
1,10,"Amazing movie from the compassionate parenting themes, token minority themes, capitalism/anarchy, forging your own path, and not letting society tell you where you belong and what you can do. They broke so many superhero and story writing “rules” and it all lead up to Miles breaking canon plot which was meta genius. The writers introduced new types of morals and messages perfectly wrapped up in a funny, emotional and action packed ride. Can’t wait for part 2!"
1,5,"Saw it. Loved it. Might be the best animated film of the year (and we have a Miyazaki film coming this year too).Couple of things...The Guidance counselor was Ms WEBer.Why Miles' parents want to ground him? He gets great grades, isn't in trouble with the cops, or does drugs. He's a teenager. Of course he's late and shifty. We got Spider-Cat, but I want Spider-Corgi!But yeah, terrific picture."
1,5,"Watched it yesterday as it was released a day earlier  in India. This movie blows the 1st one out of the park. In animation, story, character development, humor and emotional weight be it any department, it has surpassed its predecessor.The ending was kind of unexpected but now I'm actually eager for the future projects."
1,5,"I didn’t think Daniel Pemberton could top his ‘Into’ score but I think he might have. Gwen’s theme is absolutely incredible, unique, perfectly suited to the character and equally as good as Miles’s. Miguel’s theme is so looming and ominous and comes in like a barreling freight train. And oh my God the title score, even though it’s shorter than the first, just put a massive smile on my face in the theatre. Honestly, just listening to it hammers home the darker tone of this one compared to the first one. I only wish the mix in my theatre was better to appreciate it more, but a repeat viewing perhaps in IMAX might do the trick."
1,5,Best marvel IP related movie in A REALLY LONG TIME. I will be rewatching. Many many times.
1,5,I absolutely love how the one constant across the entire multiverse that we've seen so far is that JK Simmons is J Jonah Jameson
1,5,Can't wait for Huey vs Riley in Beyond!
1,5,"Spiderpunk looks like he hangs out in salt lake city, beats up rednecks and has a buddy named heroin bob who has a irrational fear of needles."
1,5,Miguel is the massive hypocrite. He himself is a walking anomaly. And what he did in his backstory was exactly the same as what Kingpin was trying to do.
1,5,Voices were way too quiet over the music
1,5,I love how this movie elevated everything good from the first one by a factor of ten. The rare sequel that is superior to the original. It's like *The Dark Knight* to Into the Spider-Verse's *Batman Begins*
1,5,peni parker redesign has me absolutely obsessed!! our girl is all grown up!! at the very end when the og gang (noir and ham) lowkey teared up omg. those are his friends!!!
1,5,"In this movie, Spider-man 2099 tells Miles that if it weren’t for him, the Spider-man of his universe would not have died. He says it was his fault his Spider-man died.So I went back and watched the first movie again but I don’t see how that statement is true? I don’t think Miles’ involvement made any difference to Spider-man’s death at all. Spider-man only stopped to save him when there was a lull in the fighting. Then, Green Goblin held Spider-man’s head into the beam shooting out of Kingpin’s machine, which then exploded and injured Spider-man. Kingpin then goes to the injured Spider-man and kills him.I don’t see how Miles in any way caused Spider-man’s death. At the very least if that statement was not a lie, then the first movie did not do a good job showing it."
0,5,Peter ParkedCar
1,5,I had high expectations going into this movie and was still completely blown away The animation is unlike anything I’ve ever seen
1,5,The ending reveal of prowler + the much darker tone reminded me a lot of empire strikes back
1,5,I can safely say this is one of the best sequels ever made. Oh my God.
1,6,"I loved Spot's ""The power of the multiverse in the palm of my hand"".  I laughed alone in my theater 😂"
0,5,#JUSTICE FOR SPIDER-HAM
1,5,The cinematography was beautiful. Every frame was a work of art
0,6,"Was there a reference to ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" in the scene where Gwen leaves the tracker in Miles's universe? I saw a billboard with a bagel and writing that seemed to be a play on the title, but I didn't catch it quick enough."
0,6,"Idk if I'm just a complete idiot but I've had something on my mind since I walked out of the theatre a few days ago.So Miguel explains that every Spider Man has a canon event where they all experience a great tragedy, and this includes Miles. But later says Miles is an anomaly and he was never supposed to be Spider Man.So do the canon events create themselves any time someone is bitten by the spider? Or does Miles have a canon event because the spider that bit him was destined to bite *someone* and it just got the wrong person? Because I feel like Miles shouldn't have a canon event because him becoming Spider Man wasn't supposed to be canon according to Miguel.Am I just being an idiot? Did I miss something? Is there a comic explanation that I'm not understanding?"
1,5,"I loved it, but not as much as the first one or Spider-Man 2. It's really hard to judge the story, though, as it's only half done. Thank god Beyond is coming in March.* The animation is incredible. I've never seen anything like it. They found the absolutely perfect balance of all the competing styles and mediums so that it never felt messy. If ITSV was a game changer for Western animation, then ATSV throws the game out the window and builds three completely new ones to replace it.* The action scenes and swinging scenes, too, are a huge improvement over the first.* The ending felt very Back to the Future-esque. Miles trapped in the wrong universe, Hobie leaving a watch for Gwen, even the ""TBC"" tag.* I like how the Spider-Verse includes not only its own multiverse, but the MCU films, Sony films, comics, video games, merch and animated series as well. It feels like a very EEAO take on this concept.* Speaking of which, weird that there's two multiverse movies that hinge on a bagel.* I have mixed feelings on the Spider Society. I find it really hard to buy into the idea that every Spider-Man in the multiverse except Miles would accept this predestination shtick. Especially when the last Spider-Man movie was about a Spider-Man trying to change the fates of dead villains. It's also weird that this seems to be the only Miles on the team, when there's so many Mileses in the multiverse. Heck, Insomniac Spider-Man shows up and he has a Miles as a protégé. * Since the release of the first game, Insomniac Spider-Man has met the comics Spider-Man in a comic book multiverse adventure and met the animated Spider-Mans in a cinematic multiverse adventure. Do you think they will address this at all, in any way in Spider-Man 2?* The sound mixing was really bad. Gwen's narration and Hobie's dialogue were unintelligible at times."
1,5,That opening sequence with Gwen was AMAZING.
0,5,Guys what song did Aaron play on his record player?! I can’t find this information anywhere? 😭😭
1,5,"No point in picking sides. Miguel's goal was the same yet diff. to Kingping. Trying to change history by intentionally taking or placing its multiverse counterpart. But he fails to notice that Miles, being the anomaly has a lot unknowns and possibilities. Miles is the byproduct of an event which already rewrited history. If the canon Algorithm stated Miles should'nt exist, it already contradicted itself with Miles's earth working fine. Miles can't save Uncle Aaron, but he can save his dad as history is up for grabs.TLDR: The canon Algorithm is flawed and Miles has the choice of saving his dad without the collaspe of the multiverse. He only needs to save his dad since the multiverse is already adapting to this new Miles."
1,5,"I feel like this runs into some of the same problems that Loki ran into, where they're saying they have to protect the universes from multiverse interference, but a lot of those events that they're trying to protect are the direct result of multiverse interference.Like they were saying that the Mumbattan canon event was the bridge falling on the Captain, but the only reason that bridge even fell was because someone from a different universe made it fall. So without multiversal interference then the Captain wouldn't have died anyways."
1,5,"Has anyone got a list of all the cameo appearances in this one? I think I saw the following:- PS4 Spider-Man- MCU Prowler / Donald Glover- Spectacular Spider-Man animated series- Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield movie scenes- Original animated series Spider-Man- Venom universe- Molina Doc Ock voice from one of the prisoners at the HQ- JK Simmons consistently being JJJ. Who can blame them, it's one of the best castings of all time.I'm sure there were loads more, I'd be curious to see what I missed."
1,5,Mahershala Ali will have been in a whole Spider-Man trilogy before Blade comes out. Hell prob before it even starts filming.
1,6,"One thing that I find interesting about this world building is that Earth-42 directly contradicts Miguel's assertion that these events must happen or the universe will end. Or, like, with Spot creating another hole in the multiverse. Miguel insists it's because Miles messed with that universe's canon, but it's obvious that that hole there is specifically because Spot blew a hole in the multiverse. What happened to Miguel is, I think, what was described in Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness, and considering how many elements were used from the MCU here, I don't think that's a coincidence. Miguel doesn't realize it, but his presence in that universe specifically caused an Incursion. But he won't accept it. I think the next film is going to be about Miles closing out his arc, of course, but also Miguel coming to understand that his actions have not always been right and condemning an infinite number of Spider people to tragic backstories makes him a monster."
0,6,"Lemme know if I'm totally off base, but could Lyla be a villain? She's the one who calculates what's a ""canon event"" or not (and Miles even points out how weird that is) who's to say she's not manipulating things just to keep producing the type of Spidermen that sustain their community?"
0,5,Does this mean that there are other Spot variants across the multiverse?
0,5,Did anyone hear in the radio in Earth-42 where it mentions the Sinister Six cartel?
1,5,"One thing I saw and am wondering if anyone else noticed since I've seen the movie multiple times, and the first two times I saw it, after Miles went ""Nah, Imma do my own thing,"" no lines were spoken until he said, ""Goodbye, Gwen."" But today I saw it a third time and after that line, he went, ""Sorry man, I'm going home."" Has anyone else noticed this?"
0,5,"Is there any significance to the several times MtG style cards are featured in the film? Miles' mom holds one briefly as she is leaving the college counselors office, some kids are playing at the party, and they're seen again in Miles' room. With them popping up multiple times, I'm curious if this is a reference I'm just not familiar with, or some kind of tie-in?"
0,5,Can someone help me understand why Miles losing his Uncle Aaron doesn’t qualify as the tragic canon event they all must have?
1,6,"I haven't seen this mentioned anywhere else, but is Oscar Isaac's ""Spidey"" actually his universe's Prowler? He's not funny (Spider-Man staple), His ""webs"" were red, and he has Prowler-like claws. I think at some point towards the end, Miles straight up says ""are you even a real Spider-Man?"" Love the movie btw."
1,5,"I wonder whether some of the Spider-Men chasing Miles actually were secretly trying to sabotage the chase.E.g.s:\- 1967 Spider-Man conveniently pulling something right when he's coming at Miles\- Cyborg Spider-Woman 'accidentally' blasting Ben Reilly, interrupting his sleeper hold on Miles. And later blowing open a vent that Miles was falling through.Of course, it's also entirely possible that the Spiders just don't work well together, considering that they usually operate individually. That could then result in them unintentionally hindering each other."
1,5,"So, just been thinking about this for a while, but if Blonde Peter destroyed the collider like Miguel claims he was supposed to, wouldn't Gwen be stuck in 1610 and inevitably die? Remember she was already in-universe before Miles got bitten...Also, I don't understand how her explanation of ""her spider senses told her to go to Miles' school"" holds up, being that Miles wasn't bitten yet, and per Miguel wasn't even supposed to get bitten.Something just doesn't add up, and it bugs me because they seem to have been pretty meticulous about putting the plot together in this movie and I think it's a pretty significant hole if it's not addressed."
1,14,"After considering the movie for a bit and looking at different opinions, I think I’ve come to recognize my own. That said, it might get refined with another viewing.Overall 8/10, I liked the first one better as it was a whole story.Pros:•	⁠Animation was beautiful•	⁠Acting was great•	⁠Plot and drama were gripping (personally, I know some people thought it was slow/boring)•	⁠Hobie best boy•	⁠Action scenes were very funCons:•	⁠Ended very abruptly. I would have preferred even ending at the point where Miles realizes he was sent to the wrong dimension, maybe add the Gwen spider team.•	⁠They rehashed the lizard Peter thing twice (once in the first movie recap, and a fuller backstory for Gwen). I think they could have kiboshed the first movie recap at the start.•	⁠Audio mixing at the start (Gwen’s monologue) was wonkyHot take(s): All the comic nerds predicting that Miguel isn’t a real Spider-Man, has a made up backstory, and will be a secret vampire villain are dumb.We saw that our Peter was with him when his universe got messed up, and making his whole trolley problem schtick just an act would undermine all the themes they worked to build up in this movie. Would they say Miles isn’t a real Spider-Man because he has slightly different powers, so he has to be a different character altogether?If I turn out to be wrong then so be it.Also:•	⁠Yes, the spider people realizing that sacrifices may need to happen is ok and within character. See the first movie, where everyone tells Miles that they all lost someone but that made them who they are. “The hardest part of this job is that you can’t always save everyone”"
1,50,yall gave it 9 or 10 huh movie an 8
1,23,"I was so happy that my theater got a new sound system or... maybe they just turned it up. The mix was terrible, I had so many moments where I just couldn't understand wtf was being said. Like Tenet bad. There is that one sequence right before the titles I swear sounds like Gwen is having a stroke or I was in the theater.The movie is visually unrivaled, it's beautiful, but it's all mostly forgetable outside of that. But maybe the first one was to in many ways? I don't remember Miles getting invisibility, but I do remember lots of bits of plot and the general vibe. Here, it's all over the place and mostly fan service.The villian in this is fun and interesting. But, the way they set him up and then just completely ignore him for the rest of the movie is just not a good look. Miles having a friend who knows his identity, but is not really a friend is weird when his whole schtick is that he can't tell people his identity and has no friends... His obessesion with Gwen and her obsession back is weird and creepy. It's not played up as love. It's like an endless hover hand over the shoulder. The parents don't seem like characters anymore, they feel like they're there to just move Miles from scene to scene. The whole fact that all Spider folks basically know and have access to all of time is kind of world breaking and makes the whole plot feel dumb. The ultimately... ending where it did was incredibly anti-climatic.Reviews for this are way too generous."
1,21,"I thought this was a boring movie, too childish for me, but then again it is a kids movie. The girl next to me fell asleep. I never saw Spidey and His Amazing Friends but this is what I imagined that to be. The showing was packed with kids and adults but all you heard was children laughter.. my own fault for expecting anything more."
1,22,Welp that was a huge nothing movie. The entire thing feels like 2 hours worth of set up.
1,23,"Never had a movie so consistently good nosedive so hard before.Terrible ending point.Title should reflect it’s a Part 1.I’m very conflicted because it genuinely ruined the experience for me, but I know when the next is out it’ll probably be amazing combined. Ultimately I can’t support this decision, it feels like a greed move to not end with any conclusion, no bonus scene and not indicator to the viewer that what they’re in for is half a product. My entire theatre was having an audible blast, and when those credits hit it was an noticeable mood kill and everyone left annoyed or pissed. Clearly they did testing and knew they’d get this reaction."
1,8,Damn this movie was so multiversal even I made a cameo (my name is Jonathan and I look exactly like Dr. Johnathan Ohnn before the spots)
1,23,"I'm kinda surprised to see such high numbers in the poll so far. I was pretty let down by this movie. Now I'll admit I hadn't seen the first one until just last night so it was still super fresh in my mind, but I don't think this one held a candle to that one at all. It was very slow, and I wasn't at all surprised to see the ""To be continued..."" at the end, because it felt like the entire movie was just prelude and build-up that never paid off. The pacing was very weird with lots of slow, dramatic scenes, a few tense scenes mixed in, and then no real payoff. And a lot of the dramatic scenes started to feel repetitive. They had very clearly made the point about the conflict between being Spider-Man and hiding it from your family by the halfway point, but then they kept hammering it over and over again.I'm assuming the climax was supposed to be the giant Spider-Man chase, but I didn't even realize it at the time because I kept expecting it to actually go somewhere with the main villain afterwards. Instead we had to be reminded that he even exists at the end of the movie because he just vanished for two days. And the movie was only two hours long but it felt way longer. I had to keep resisting the urge to check the time and see how long I'd been sitting there. Not to say I was bored, but I wasn't edge of my seat either. And my friends' kids that came with us were definitely getting fidgety long before that point. The older one said she was kinda confused by the end too, and I can definitely see how the plot would be a bit confusing for kids."
1,22,"Halfway through, kinda boring ngl."
1,18,"The first one was a 10/10 for me. Truly so inventive both visually and storytelling wise.Second one is a 8/10.Overall story wise I didn’t find it as fresh as the first. I didn’t find the villains to be as menacing or interesting as the prowler or kingpin in the first one. The Spot felt like comedic relief and Miguel felt like a character that feels too familiar. Spot felt like he was quickly forgotten midway and then the movie focuses on Miguel, The spiderverse Canon, doppelgänger multiverse shinangans and by the time it comes back to Spot arriving in Mile’s universe - everything left for Part 2 feels like a forgone conclusion (impending big Marvel battle/war) that I don’t necessarily feel invested in.I didn’t like the live action fan service. It just felt inelegant and unnecessary for some reason.The standout overall for me was Gwen’s universe both visually and story wise.On an unrelated note - Did anyone else find the coming out scenes very queer coded?"
1,20,"Man, I think I'm multiverse'd out. This movie feels like a Rick and Morty episode, council of ~~Mortys~~ Spider-Men included. How many multiverse stories have we gotten in the past few years? There's  been Loki, Into the Spiderverse, Dr Stange 2, No Way Home, EEAAO.  It almost seems trite at this point.I think there was a point in the movie where they even reference this. Someone says something like ""The fate of the multiverse is at stake."" and someone else retorts something like ""I don't even know what that means anymore.""Moreover, I think its constant meta references uncut a lot of the sincere emotional core of the movie. It may have well as Lego Spider-Man for how much it delights in referencing other properties.I still loved the movie, but I think it goes from a 10/10 to a 9/10 for me, just because I'm burnt out on multiverses."
1,20,"Very hard on the eyes, and the dialogue was sometimes hard to hear. The ending sucked.Good movie tho, fun references, fun cameos.7.5"
1,17,"Good movie, but really hard to get me emotionally invested in it, same problems with the first one. I guess they're trying to appeal to children(?) with the constant jokes straight after an emotional scene, which is kind of kills the vibe of the scene.Nitpicks:- a pregnant superhero? Really??- taking care of a baby WHILE fighting?? - using said baby to make someone less angry in a conversation?? -overweight spiderman?? Really?? How can they do backflips and web around when they're starring on my 600lb life??  - Peter Parker saying random ass stuff to say that he was ""inspired"" by miles to have a kid. Really?? May be I need to watch the first movie again because I don't haven't the slightest recollection of that ever being happening/or being implied. - the whole ""spider-society"" tf. One scene they show some spiderman holding guns and marching like they're soldiers..? What, aren't yall litteraly spiderman? Why are you guys marching?? - villains lack depth (unsurprisingly, it's a superhero movie)... Are not interesting. Hopefully spiderman 2099 gets more development in the future movie. - weird dialogue at times, when spiderman 2099 is chasing miles on the train and out of nowhere miles starts his monologue ""... My name is miles morales. I was a bitten by a radioactive spider...""  blah blah blah. Why, why are you saying these words miles. I litteraly started laughing at loud at the absurdity of it all. - unnecessary tension build up for scenes, that when you look back on, eas completely unnecessary. When miles is seeing gwen go to the Indian spiderman dimension, wtf was the point of miles being invisible and taking a moment to decide. -characters don't make sense. Or evil miles morales knocking out good miles morales dor some reason? Or the uncle punching him for some reason? Character decisions don't make sense. -the fucking cameos, oh my soul the cameos. I DONT CARE IF IT'S DONALD GLOVER OF TOBY MAGUIRE PLEASE LET'S GET BACK TO THE MOVIE. But other people adore it so eh.- goofy at times which kills the immersion. Kung fu panda 2 had tbe perfect amount of gofyness but still made me ball my eyes out.- scenes are weirdly built up. Miles's uncle starts playing music for some reason. I feel like a lot of emphasis is placed on ""aesthetic if the scene"" instead of a scene naturally flowing out between the characters... Again, killing my immersion.- building fake tension in a scene when there is no tension.- story is a mess at times, which is probably because of the above mentioned factors.- also spiderman 2099 said that stopping a cannon event breaks the universe. Which we were shown to be a true statement. Now, miles has zero idea how to stop his father dying, and even if he does, it's going to kill everyone in his universe. He has zero plans on how to stop that too. So his rebellion against spiderman 2099 makes zero sense. I really hoped they don't put in some bullshit plot device that let's miles save his dad and his universe. Other than that, Gwen's story was nice, but loved her scenes with miles even more. Miles scenes with his family were also ten out of ten. These two were the highlight of the movie. Animation was great too, so was the music."
1,20,"I'm ready for the down votes, but unfortunately I found Across The Spider-Verse underwhelming. Its not at all a bad movie, but it was no where near the expected greatness I heard about. I'll just quickly brush over my thoughts:The pacing was off. I totally get the character building they were trying to do, but I found that the film stayed uncomfortably long on scenes that didnt seem to move the plot forward. Miles and his parents clearly are having issues, but instead of his parents taking any real action toward figuring why their son is always disappearing, they take it fairly easy on him and ultimately give him a pass to do whatever he wants. In reality, concerned parents would of worried their son is either on drugs, or messing with a girl or a bad crowd of people. And after seeing Miles with Gwen, would of immediately suspected she's the reason for his weird behavior and taken appropriate action. The Spot was... interesting. I definitely like how they made him a bigger threat than he was jn the comics. But, his motivations were a bit flimsy to me. I get his anger toward Miles, but with how angry he was with Miles you'd think Miles did everything to him on purpose. In reality Miles did what he had to in order to save the universe, and the spot was an unfortunate casualty of that. Despite this, the Spot hates his guts and wants to ruin his entire life. Idk, just doesnt work for me. On top of that, at a certain point he barely pops again and I had nearly forgotten he was even the main villain.The legion of Spidermen was awesome, and the way the easter eggs worked into the story was satisfying. I totally caught spectacular spiderman, spiderman unlimited, alex ross spiderman, and a few other spidermen I recognize. Spider-Man 2099 was great and had very convincing motivations.The film was visually exhilarating, but there were times where it felt overwhelming; like when gwen was talking to her dad, the drawing style kept changing and it just seemed unnecessary. Overall, a good movie. Not great, not horrible. A worthwhile sequel that is as flawed as it is good. I feel the 1st had a better, more concentrated story."
1,18,"Just came out of watching this movie and i had fun but I’m disappointed and just can’t judge the movieIt’s a fun movie, it’s well animated.  But this isn’t a whole product.I had read a comment here before watching it that the ending teased a third movie and that at least we wouldn’t have to wait that long for the new one (maybe there is an announcement already?)But this? I didn’t expect this ending.This is not a full movie. It cannot be judged. The final arc just doesn’t exist. Just when it’s starting it’s completely cut off. As a writer and story teller this really bothers me. I know why they did it but it felt too sudden.And mostly I guess it comes down to expectations. There are plenty of movies that tease there will be another movie, but they are complete arcs by themselves.Other movies, for example avengers infinity war, we already know in advance there was going to be another movie, in fact originally they were announced as part 1 and 2 before they were given names.And even if we didn’t know there was going to be an Avengers End game before hand, the arc of the story is still complete. Thanks set out to do something, progressed through the story and in the end achieves it and completes its arc. We know there will be more of course but the arc isn’t cut short.Maybe if it was announced and promoted as part one and two. But it wasn’t"
1,7,"I think I loved a lot of things about this movie but like... goddamn what a weird place to end it.Like I knew I was going to be a two-parter but I was not prepared for just ending like halfway through a story arc, like I thought there would be some sort of resolution there idk.There's just no payoff really. Like Infinity War we Thanos the whole movie as he tries to do one very specific thing and everyone else tries to stop him, and then at the end that thing happens and we just have to sit with it for a year.This movie like nobody really had a big overarching goal for half of it, and then we meet Miguel and then we get some more stuff about the multiverse but it's... I don't know we just don't get any pay off at the end basically. The third movie really better deliver is what I'm saying"
1,8,"Okay, so show of upvotes or replies: How many of us *actually* remember when this movie was first marketed as Part One? Because I noticed that they dropped the “part one” in the title and just hoped that they pulled an *Infinity War* and NOT a *Justice League* on that…And I’m noticing a lot of people surprised by the ending."
1,7,"I like how they began the film with Gwen and lead on to Miles.It's a simple thing but avoiding the whole ""3 months earlier"" flashback sequence gave the movie this flow that could ramp up or down as needed.All of the characterisation was great, especially Miguel. The trailers had me expecting this angry and authoritative figure but he's clearly sympathetic to Miles' plight (in his own fashion).Prav was awesome. I'm surprised and a little disappointed that he wasn't present when they were discussing the canon. Don't think he would have agreed with the idea of letting Captain Singh die.Negatives: the third act was far too long. They could have cut it at numerous points and maintained the energy and emotion the movies was building up to.Instead, it just felt like a runway train, unable to stop at the designated station."
1,8,"I love how The Spot starts off being a joke and by the end is a genuinely intimidating threat, completely sold by Jason Shwartzman’s voice acting."
1,7,Was critical going into the movie and didn't even see the first one.Absolutly loved it. Funniest and at the same time one of the most emotional Super Hero Movies. They nailed the family dynamics.The scene with Gwen and Miles in Front of the upside down Skyline while Self Love is playing in the background might be my favorite movie scene of the year so far.

1,26,"So I overall enjoyed the film, but there was one moment that really didn’t work for me: I really disagree with the decision to show the send-me-home machine when Miles is using it. It VERY clearly (albeit quickly) shows that he’s going to universe 42. The rug-pull/plot-twist moment of revealing that Miles is in the wrong universe is built up to as this big thing, but it’s completely undermined by the fact that the movie has already outright shown, as a fact, that he’s in the wrong one. They should’ve avoided this and let the different art (and Miguel’s earlier explanation as to how the machine works) be enough to make the audience sceptical, before revealing Gwen going into the room and not finding Miles/Rio not knowing who Spider-Man is. If you caught that he went to dimension 42, the next several minutes of build-up to the reveal just feels very drawn out and unnecessary.Maybe a bit of a nit pick. I do like that he ended up in the wrong universe, it’s a good twist. I just feel like they misstepped by first outright revealing that to anyone watching closely, instead of teasing it out, before ultimately having Miles explicitly state it. It’s just kinda like, yeah, I know, I saw what the machine said several minutes ago, the character is just catching up to the audience now and I’m not as invested in his reaction, because I don’t share it.I also don’t think this movie is as good as the first, though I also consider the first to be one of my favourite films of all time, if not outright #1. I feel like this one just didn’t have the same emotional weight and memorable moments that we had before. Plus, Miles’ whole conflict of “I need to go save my dad” doesn’t entirely make sense to me. Miguel and the others talk about every Spider-Man having “their moment” where they lose someone and it changes who they are… but IN THAT SAME CONVERSATION the computer shows Miles losing Uncle Aaron alongside the simulations of everyone else losing someone. It seems to be showing that this was his moment - a sentiment explicitly stated in the first film, mind you - before then stating that he’s going to lose someone else. The movie just kinda seems to re-write its own rules there. EDIT: Someone pointed out that this scene was used to portray that Spider-Man always loses someone close to them AND a police captain, not one or the other. I may have misunderstood this scene if that’s the case.The central conflict of a Spider-Man having to choose between saving someone they care about and saving everyone is always a good story though. And I really like that he didn’t just accept the situation, but has a knee jerk reaction of “save him now, figure out the rest later”. It’s a lot less noble than so many similar stories where the hero just accepts what needs to be done. And Peter and Gwen needing to re-evaluate their personal choices to side with Miguel after Miles clearly feels betrayed by them is fantastic. All throughout the chase scene, it felt like neither of them knew who’s side they were on.Spot getting sidelined once Miguel was introduced is understandable but unfortunate. The story pretty much stops paying attention to the main villain (not main antagonist, mind you, that would be Miguel) halfway through the movie, despite him being built up to as this climactic, world destroying villain. The third movie will have a lot to juggle between him, Prowler, and Miguel as antagonists. With a sufficient runtime though, I trust they’ll pull it off."
1,17,"I definitely need to rewatch this the second I get a chance but HOLY shit.Alright first things first, animation beat the first one out of the park (as expected). The amount of easter eggs and references were so damn delightful to the point where I want to go back and pause each frame to see what I missed. Just to name a few:-Donald Glover as Prowler referencing Spider-Man Homecoming (literally unbelievable and i'm so happy they did this-Ganke playing Spider-Man PS4 -Spectacular Spider-Man makes a short appearance as well but honestly I was just glad I got to see my favoriate childhood spidey for the first time in over 13 years. -Live action spidey scenes yadda you get the jistAnyways I do feel like the pacing of this movie was a bit off? The first hour essentially felt like the first movie which is not a complaint but a bit too slow for something that was marketed as a multiversal rollercoaster (the marketing was awful for this movie as many would agree and I wasn't expecting just a random shitfest but it felt underwhelming), but the actual movie starts around the second half where it finds its emotional depth and shit just gets really fun. I loved Miles' character development and us watching his growth as not only Spider-Man but just as a good hearted kid wanting to do the right thing. The message of wanting a place to belong was really beautiful and the importance of family was showcased in a way where it wasn't cheesy as you'd normally expect from a ""kids movie"". Speaking of that, this movie gets DARK in the second half. The tone slowly gets eerie and I fucking loved it. At some points, I forgot this was a PG movie, the producers did a phenomenal job with the writing. Now as for the ending, i'm a bit conflicted with it. On one hand, i'm very happy we are getting another installment of this, the finale of the trilogy BUT it felt like the last 20 minutes were moreso just a teaser/staircase leading upto the next movie. Now I understand it's a two part finale but at the same time, it causes this movie to feel less like a standalone and moreso just a stepping stone, one that'll be forgotten by next year when something bigger and greater comes. As opposed to infinity war, which in it's own right was a great movie with a solid ending because yes it was predictable in endgame where avengers save the day and blah, BUT there was at least a definitive ending to infinity war where Thanos wins instead of being ambigious. Overall, apart from the jackshit marketing which gave off argubably the best parts of the movie,weird pacing and ending, it is probably one of the best superhero projects in the last 10 years."
1,16,"Good movie but If I knew the whole movie was just a setup, I wouldn't have watched it in a theater"
1,15,"Did anyone else despise the ending??Why do they make 4 star films with 1 star endings.Honestly, devastatingly dissapointed with it."
1,13,"ITTSV is by far the best Spider-Man movie, but I’m really not understanding the love for this sequel. Undeniably beautiful and ground breaking animation but next to no plot. The film is just 90% spider-men chasing other Spider-Men around and then leaves the audience on a cliffhanger. I also hate two-parter movies, films should be self contained stories or you’re just making TV. Understand I’m in the minority here though and am happy so many others enjoyed it. 🕷️😊"
1,10,"Did anyone else think the ending was very disappointing because it seems like Miles prowler situation is easily solvable We already see him starting to escape with the venom powers and Gwens group is looking for him, Gwen also knows he's in the wrong dimension which Miguels group doesn't The prowler twist just seems really low stakes to me, as Miles can easy escape or be broken out.Also the entire movie builds towards Miles opening up to his parents, and then it just doesn't matter. It feels really unsatisfying"
1,24,I love the animation but the end left a bad taste in my mouth. If they wanted it longform then they should not have made it a movie. Where's the end? I paid a movie ticket for an episode??? I'll still watch Beyond the Spiderverse somehow but not gonna pay for it.
1,22,I’ve never seen a more attention-disorder-pandering movie about a villain. This was bad. Cool animation.
1,15,"Gonna farm some down arrows... but I didn't like it as much as I had hoped.Like, it either felt 1 hour too long or 1 hour too short to be satisfying. I went in there not knowing it was a 2-parter, but when it got to Miles meeting Miles and Gwen assembling the team I was like *man, this has only just been the 2nd act, the fuck, feels like I've been sat here for 3 hours*... and then it was just over.The beginning felt like it dragged on for way too long without much happening - I'd like to think that there could've been a better way to show Miles and Gwen living through the same struggles that wasn't just showing the same story basically twice.Stuff got pretty neat once we got to the spiderverse part, but even there... I think the movie could've done with less Spider-Man running away from Spider-Man and here's the 97th Spider-Man variant - like, not that it was bad, just that it started to drag on eventually.Spot dude was pretty neat, but kinda just vanished halfway through the movie to make room for Miguel to become the ""villain"" and shout his way through the final hour of the movie.Also, I kinda think that both the music and the visuals were better in the first one.Like, I think the movie had a solid 90 minutes worth of a very good story... but repeating the same points over and over and over again while cramming in a solid 137 cameos just didn't do it for me. I'm kinda worried the next movie is gonna be like that as well - a solid 90 minutes worth of plot stretched out to 2+ hours to justify the 2-parter, probably because a single 3h movie just wouldn't work (although I would've most likely prefered that).Again, not that it was bad... but it didn't hit me like the first one did. Obviously gonna rewatch it 27 times though, so there's that. Also, pretty sad about no prost-credit - even just a slight sneak peak at what's about to come woulda been swell. *Kiiiiinda* felt like they've leaned a bit too hard into *""worked for Infinity War and Endgame, so it's gonna work for us as well""* for me."
1,12,The first film was way betterMiles better actually
1,11,"How is nobody talking about how the film is completely missing an ending? No arcs are resolved, no stories lead to a conclusion, no payoffs for any foreshadowing. The entire third act is just missing. I liked the beginning and the middle, but without an ending I honestly can't really appreciate them. I feel a bit swindled to be honest."
1,9,"I feel like I’m on drugs. Why is no one upset that this movie had no ending? Everyone in my theater was baffled, but no one on the internet seems to even notice."
1,9,"There's six different conflicts, and we don't get a real one until halfway through the second act. The second and third acts are basically nonstop exposition that doesn't really further the plot, and they just keep going over the same issues again and again. Miles' conflict with The Spot could be resolved with one earnest conversation, Miles' conflict with Gwen keeps getting expanded on in different ways without real resolution or cohesion, and we don't learn about the universe Canon until the movie is halfway over. In the first Spiderverse movie had a central conflict established in the first fifteen minutes. I wish this movie knew what it wanted to be about. &#x200B;The constant changing of animation style was cool at first but then they started doing it so fast that it just became distraction. I liked the visuals of the sequence in Mumbattan because it stuck to one visual style long enough to actually appreciate it, but then the third act had so many different animation styles and color palettes that it just sort of became visual sludge. &#x200B;And lastly, stop using quips and jokes to defuse tense and meaningful scenes. Let tension exist. It sucks when Marvel does it, don't try it. We heard that same ""bad teacher"" joke from Peter Parker four times in ten minutes."
1,8,"Ok. Was that the *Spectacular Spider-Man* version of Peter cradling Captain Stacy's dead body???As in, there's a universe where that show's world basically continued past Season 2?Holy fuckkkk."

1,6,"OK so I loved it. I loved every second of it. Art style, soundtrack, writing, everything.BUT tell me if anyone else had this problem with it: The same as Fast X, I felt like this movie had no 'main event' or climax of its own. Rather, it just felt a bit incomplete and unsatisfying, and a setup for the finale.At first, I thought maybe this is just how it has to be with two-part movies. But then I remembered how Infinity War/Endgame managed to do it so well, making even the first movie feel like its own, whole thing, even with the most deadly cliffhanger of all time. I wonder why this movie or Fast X couldn't do quite that. And I wonder if Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part 1 will be the same way."
1,6,"Sony did it again. This movie blows the first out of the water somehow and now I think Spider-man is my favorite franchise. Sony is doing a better job setting up the multiverse than MCU's Kang crap. There's so much happening on screen yet they still keep it understandable. The music, artwork, characters, it's all a masterpiece. Every single frame is some of the most creative and expressive stuff I've seen in modern media. Props to Sony Animation."
1,6,"Honestly, no joke, this is the best piece of content I've ever experienced (not just movies, I'm including series and video games too)."
1,7,"it just fucking hit me, what “beyond the spider verse”means. It means beyond the universes where Spider-Man exists. Earth 42 is one of them, and we’re about to see more."
1,5,"It's a tiny detail, but I loved that both Gwen and Miles had B's in classes for one of their native languages (English and Spanish, respectively), and both gave the excuse that they had just missed a few classes (because of being a superhero). Fun to catch the small details that show just how closely all of the spider-peoples' lives line up, even outside of the major canon events and the other characters in their lives.Once again, outstanding animation which went beyond the style of the first movie, giving each universe its own distinctive flair and sometimes giving clues in scenes that didn't take place in the universe that we thought we were seeing (like when Miles's mom has green instead of brown eyes). An excellent sequel and great setup for a third film. If they can stick the landing this will end up being the most complete and consistent spiderman trilogy to-date, imo"
1,7,"Alright, unpopular opinion, but I felt like it dragged on at times, a lot of stuff definitely could have been taken out in my opinion"
1,6,Is anyone else really annoyed that they basically put the entire climax of the movie/Miles’ big moment in the trailers?? Couldn’t properly enjoy the entire Nueva York sequence because I felt like I’ve literally seen it twenty times.
1,5,"It was a great movie. I went in not knowing it was a ""part 1"" and that left me disappointed.I hate when movies end with ""to be continued"" and do not tell a complete story. It recently happened with Dune (yeah I understand that's how the book ends) and the newest Avatar (I feel like the second matrix movie ended without a real ending) -- they just come off as setups for the next flick. I may be weird about this, but I think that a movie should try to have some sort of conclusion. I get that there is more to the story, but try wrap up something. Maybe im just too used to the whole `discovery, conflict, resolution` approach that is in basically every movie or maybe im forgetting how other great multipart movies didn't tell whole stories in the individual movie.Anyway, I'll be at opening weekend when the next one drops"
1,6,"I loved the movie. But sadly my experience was brought down by the people that like to fucking talk during the movie and explain it to their friends. I don't give a shit if you recognize an easter egg, your friends probably don't give a shit either. I don't know why this is becoming very common in movie theaters. And if you tell them to shut up they feel offended. I just wanted to vent."
1,6,"The whole movie is fucking 10/10. I was on the edge of my seat in second half. Each frame is so beautiful to look at. For a moment I forgot it was two-parter and i believe whole theatre too cause of the collective “oh, c’mon” when that “To be continued” appeared on screen. The only slight very tiny tiny issue: the songs were no where as good as the first one."
1,6,"Saw it last night and I can't stop thinking about it. That movie was an absolute masterclass in storytelling and animation. Not for a moment did I think it dragged and there were multiple times where I was just in awe of how beautiful every frame looked. It was almost distractingly gorgeous at times, and the way the soundtrack almost melded beat by beat to the frames was incredible. The whole beginning segment with the opening, then Gwen playing drums was just unreal animation, and the movie really didn't slow down. I am upset that Transformers is taking over the IMAX/Dolby screens because I'll definitely be seeing it one or two more times. The Spot was a perfect villian and the dilemma between the Spiderman 2099 crew vs. Miles was one where I still don't know what side I'd be on. Just unbelievably good.My only complaint was the audio in some parts, especially at the beginning, was low in my theater to where I thought it wasn't nearly loud enough and I missed a few lines of dialogue."
1,6,"Pretty sure I’m the only person who didn’t love this movie, it’s good… but not worth the hype"
1,6,"My friends were talking and laughing during the whole movie, I should have just seen it by my self tbh"
1,6,"Great start, tedious ending. Way to drawn out with his family stuff, we get it. Good movie but if they would have edited 20 mins or so it could have been fantastic."
1,8,I didn't like that they made all the spider man just agree to the fact that they gotta let miles' father die. Most spider man wouldn't stand for that.
1,8,"Probably in the minority here. The movie felt like it was edging me the whole time. Somehow I feel like it didn't really advance the story that much, it just kind of dragged. Love the animation and music just not the story"
1,19,Miguel really is the hero in this story. Miles is crazy
1,12,That ending was one of the biggest movie mistakes I can think of. What were they thinking?
1,11,"I wasnt the biggest fan compared to the first one.  Too much visual clutter for the sake of it, the parts with Miles' parents dragged, and I hated the cliffhanger."
1,10,"It seems like I'm in the minority on this one but I was disappointed by this movie. The visuals were just too overwhelming at times (that first battle between Vulture and Gwen/Miguel/Jess was particularly hard to follow) and the sound mixing was awful, though I think that was partially my theater's fault, they seemed to crank up the volume way too high early in. But the main reason I'm disappointed is because of the ending. I'm ok with a cliffhanger ending, but not when it doesn't feel like an ending at all. There is no resolution, there is no completion of Miles' arc. Infinity War is what a cliffhanger ending should be: a movie that gives us a proper ending, and a resolution to the main character's journey: it still functions on its own as its own individual movie that doesn't need Endgame to be complete. This movie doesn't function at all as its own film, especially when the first half of this movie is basically all setup. I think I will like this film more when Beyond the Spider-Verse comes out and the story is actually complete, but right now I'm frustrated at how incomplete this was."
1,9,"Let me preface this by saying that I fully understand that I'm in the minority on this.The ending really took the wind out of the sails for me. I knew it was a two-parter going in, but I was incredibly dissatisfied with the actual cliffhanger. Nothing happens and there's no real immediate threat. Miles is the wrong universe? Not a problem. There's hundreds of Spider-People who can travel to any dimension with the press of a button and they're all looking for him. Gwen was able to survive in his world for a week in ITSV, so the glitching isn't an issue. Miguel and his crew want to stop Miles? Not an issue. He already single-handedly defeated them all and they are shown to be mostly idiots. Even the main villain is a non-threat. Despite looking extremely cool, he does nothing to solidify himself as an actual danger. He's such a non-threat that the movie completely ignores him for the entire third act.People keep comparing it to Empire Strikes Back or Infinity War, but I don't think that's true. Empire builds to Luke confronting Vader. That's what he's training for and why Vader is building his trap. Infinity War revolves entirely around Thanos's snap and ends with him completing his goal. Those movies, Two Towers, Back to the Future Part 2 - they all give the characters a clear mission at the start and conclude that particular story. This just stops halfway, not because it's a good stopping point but because they ran out the clock.Again, just to be clear, I loved this movie and I'll see Beyond opening night, but that cliffhanger absolutely missed the mark for me."

1,12,"There are things in this movie that are absolutely amazing. The animation is even better than ITSV (the stuff in Gwen’s universe and in Nueva York particularly), Hobie is an amazing new character, I love Gwen’s arc with her dad, the structural and thematic writing were good.But I really did not enjoy watching it. Most of the movie that isn’t the Pre-Credits sequence with Gwen and the Nueva York sequence did not really work for me. The pacing felt WAY off, I did not like Miles, I did not like his Dad. The dialogue writing and performances on those characters felt weirdly off. The ending “falling action” was bizarre and it felt like they added climactic music and chopped that part up to make it feel like an ending but it ended up feeling like a bad music video.Also oh my god the sound mix????? What the fuck was going on - how did this release in that state?I’m gonna wait til I see the next one to see if this pays off and try a rewatch. I hope so but honestly a really frustrating watch because it should have been amazing."
1,9,First one was way better. This doesn’t even come close except for animation and style. Yes animation is mind blowing and gets even better with this one. But in terms of story and plot this one felt very lazy writing and cliche cookie cutter characters. The Indian version was a complete stereotype character. And it felt too long. They could easily cut 45 mins to an hour and it wouldn’t change anything. Disappointed overall!
1,7,"The more I think about this movie the less it makes any sense.The main conflict is between Miguel, who wants to allow Miles' dad to die and preserve the canon, versus Miles, who wants to save his dad no matter what. Except, every spiderman obviously *tries* to save their universe's Captain, so Miles trying to save his own universe's Captain wouldn't even be a problem, he'd just fail. Pavi tries to save Captain Singh and is going to fail, it is the interference of other universe Spidermen (Miles) that breaks canon.So Miguel's plan to trap Miles and make sure he can't be involved in his own universe's canon event makes no sense. Maybe you could argue that Miguel is either crazy or evil, or has hidden motives, etc. But he also convinces hundreds of other spidermen to go along with this nonsense, as shown in the ""intervention"" scene, so that doesn't even work to fix the plot hole.Also, Miguel's plan must have been hatched sometime during the Mumbattan section, because directly before that Gwen is explicitly told *not* to interfere with Miles. What about the intervening events changed things so dramatically? I can't begin to guess and the movie certainly doesn't offer even a word of explanation.So those are the actual plot holes. I would say there is also a huge storytelling problem because the main issue, the canon breaking, is completely abstract and imaginary. It's literally, ""our computer models are telling us to do this"". This is just, what the hell. Incredibly weak storytelling. Imagine if, instead of a big scary Death Star that we see blow up a whole planet in the first act, Star Wars was all about ""our computer models show that the Empire will win unless we follow the invisible Way of the Force, which has no physical manifestation and is not spelled out clearly in any way."""
1,7,Anyone else not love it?
1,7,"Watched it this afternoon, and it was great….but….not as good as the first.Visually it was stunning. So many art styles in one movies (including live action).Storywise……meh. Took to long to get the to the actual plot of the movie and when it did it felt to short (yes, I know there’s a part two due next year).Soundtrack…fantastic, one of the highlights of the movie.I’m looking forward to the next one though, and I’ll defo watch this again at some point."
1,8,"Hmm.. So just want to vent abit here. The movie is great animation and music wise, however i have so many bones to pick with the story and the way it ended. I feel like half of it is definitely due to the feeling the movie left me with the to be continue thing, but I also just hate how they characterize every other spiderman in this movie. Like... 2099 make sense, he tried to break the so called canon event himself and suffer the consequences of it, so it make sense that he have a personal feelings towards said issue. But I cant for the life of me believed that the rest of the spidy, least of all Peter B Parker and Gwen would ever agreed to ""not try"" again when they could have save someone, especially if that someone is Miles's father. Granted they make their own team in the end against the other spidy and all but they should have never even agreed with it to begin with. Also the idea of canon event in itself is stupid. Like we see how easily it can ""break"" just because Gwen dad decided to not be a cop anymore, and you cant tell me across an infinite universe that doesn't happen at all until Gwen and Miles turn. On that topic if 2099 called Miles an anomaly why would he even be so sure that Miles would follow all other spider in their canon event? Also why would a multiverse be a thing if all event is supposed to playout the same anyway? Are all of them expected to go down the zombie path just because 1 zombieverse existed somewhere? Or maybe all universe will be destroyed by Dr Strange because he did it in multiple universe? They even reference the MCU Strange event so is the canon rule only applied to spidy or what?But again i guess im just feeling so mad at all these details mainly because of the to be continue thing, and i would have overlooked alot of them without that thing, so who knows..."
1,7,To be honest I found a lot of this movie kinda cringey after the first hour. Especially the Spider-Man India ( I do appreciate the representation but it felt like the TikTok verison of what it meant to be Indian)I really dislike the idea of Spider-Man being willing to sacrifice 1 person even for the whole universe at least without trying to save them before hand. It goes against stories like no one dies which are all about that concept.
1,5,Every trailer before the movie was as awful as this was greatImpressive
1,5,"This movie proved that there is no superhero fatigue, only bad movie fatigue.There are *so many* variants of so many characters, and just as many locations. Yet all the same, the movie remains concise and engaging. The duration is the only element that I had an issue with. Granted, it's been a while since the first movie, but all the same, most character introductions and recaps were unnecessary. And many dialogue scenes were far too long.EDIT: Spelling."
1,6,"Utterly amazing film from beginning to end. Explored the tropes of being a superhero and the entire spider-man mythos while still being visually fantastic, full of action and lots of fun. It's my favourite film of the year and if the finale is anything like the first two it's going to be a classic cinema trilogy up there with Star Wars and LOTR."
1,5,"Well that was a goddamn work of art. Gwen’s world is the most beautiful animation I have probably seen. Only small gripes for me is I felt the movie was a slight bit too long, and I also felt like Spot’s origin reminded me of Jamie Foxx’s Electro in TASM 2. The nerdy guy who wants to be noticed or appreciated by Spiderman to the villain who wants to destroy Spiderman for casting him aside. Clearly, Spot is better but that parallel was weird for me."
1,5,"Great movie, got some criticisms i haven't seen anybody mention though \- **Sound** **mix**, i don't know if this is IMAX specific but the sound mix was the worst i've personally experienced in a movie theatre The music was booming, the action fx were soft and the voices were even softer - it felt like my brain was an ai taking sentence fragments and formulating the rest. \- The first 1/4 of the movie with Gwen really dragged for me, again maybe because of the mix i wasn't as immersed but while it was interesting it felt wayy too slow\- Specific nitpick but i thought the scene where Gwen comes out of Miles room was weird, his parents really didn't react enough for me lol the girl just comes out of his room, tells them she came through the window and Miles is missing\- Also i loathed every second of ""the dot"" he was just really annoying, a cool villain idea but was so annoying and i was very happy his screen time was like 25%"
1,6,"Anyone else think that Gwen will die in the next movie? I feel like the movie foreshadowed that Miles' parents will be saved but Gwen won't survive. They gave her closure with her dad in this movie, and added foreshadowing by telling us nothing good happens to Gwen and Spiderman. Also, her telling her dad she'll be right back kinda sealed it for me."
1,5,"Definitely enjoyed the first more could definitely tell this movie was made by a different director, the third act pacing was abit all over the place and too long imo and i wish got more from 2099, but i loved everything else about this movie especially the soundtrack and visuals"
1,9,One thing I was confused about was Miles not using his invisibility when he was getting chased by the spiderman army in Nueva York. Did I miss a crucial piece of info here?
1,10,I think I like the 1st one more.  There was too much family talk growing up bs and the 1st had plenty of that don't get me wrong.....I dunno it was alright not enough action in my opinion
1,9,Great film. But disappointed with the music. Then again the first one set the standard so high it was impossible to match up. Especially with Sunflower and Whats up danger. Felt the film was missing that vibe song that went great with the story. Oh well hoping for that in the next film though.
1,9,"I loved most of movie&#x200B;But Seeing ALL the spider-men, but miles go ""yea we just let them die and we are gunna stop you from trying"" was the most un spider-man thing I have seen in my life, Actually a bunch of spider-man teaming up together to do it? even worse, Spider-men are supposed to do the right thing no matter what and find a way to fix the consequences cause thats who they workI mean shit even OG spider-man tries to stop him for a bit, the fuck?&#x200B;So anyways Fucking hated that"
1,10,"The movie was good but not 9/10 good, it was not as good as the first one.The visuals were again very good although at certain times there were far too many shit happening in very little time which was annoying to watch. Other than that 10/10. The story however, the story suffered a bit, my best guess it's because they made it into a two part series which I didn't knew about before going to see it. It felt like often times we were dragging on and on without going anywhere, miles has the same talk with his parents like 3-4 times and I seriously don't understand why he thinks that his parents will not love him if he tells them he is Spiderman. Gwen is scared because her father hates spiderwoman and hunts her down, but Miles? His dad and law enforcement have a good relationship with miles as Spiderman and the previous Spiderman has left a good legacy for the people. So their struggle should be, his parents worrying about his safety and wanting him to stop doing it. The spider lady being very pregnant and on a bike should not have been on the main Spiderman 2099 team but just another background Spiderman. It just looks so silly. Finally I can't help but notice that Peter B Parker is still kinda a joke, sure he did get to fight his demons, make up with mj and seemingly have a nice life but why does he have to walk around with a pink robe and have his kid with him? Can't mj look out for the kid while her husband is busy saving the multiverse? Feels like they try to keep the the one that looks the more like the OG Spiderman as a joke in fear of him stealing miles' thunder. If the team of Spiderman was actually a small elite force as Gwen first said (thus no pregnant lady cmon) I could understand our boy from 616 not being there, but then we find out that literally every dimension's spiderman is over there so where is the OG??? Also the web stuff was kinda silly for me, Miguel was able to track 5he webbof destiny and see that mile's father was bound to die in 2 days, so you are telling me that dude can literally see the future? How about going a bit past that point to see how events play out?Also web of destine and shit but madam web nowhere to be seen... Sad."
1,9,Animation saved the movie. Pretty mid movie over all. First one was significantly better
1,9,"Animation was great, but I couldn't help but feel with all of the different Spidermen it kind of cheapens the character itself - like why should I care about Miles Morales if there's another million universes with other Spidermen? The plot was also nothing special imo; those saying this is the greatest superhero film of all time are sprouting hyperbole.**Overall rating for Across the Spider-Verse (2023): 7/10. Amazing animation but personally wasn't invested in the characters.**"
1,11,I can't be the only one who saw the massive trans imagery in Gwen's entire universe?
1,13,"Am I the only one who is of the opinion that Miguel O'Hara was actually right all along and he really is the good guy and should be the leader? Because going through all these comments it looks like everyone is clearly on Miles' side. Even though he's risking the destruction of a whole universe. It may just be me, but I hate the trope of much lovey-dovey little feelings and emotions taking precedence over the perseverance of the UNIVERSE!The story makes it very obvious that disrupting a canon event can easily snowball into destroying the universe eventually. So at the cost of 1 single person's life we should risk all of existence? What an awful idea. Another way of thinking about this is say that you know that you are about to approach a fork in the road. 1 direction leads to a non-zero (albeit an unquantified) chance that the entire universe will eventually end at the end of this road. Meanwhile, the other direction leads to a ZERO chance that this will happen. But in order to take the second option you must pay the price of 1 life. What a cheap and low price. That's a steal. Almost literally!For sure it's not fun and very sad for the immediate circle of the 1 life that's sacrificed, but what you gain in return easily justifies the cost in such mind boggingly and nigh-incomprehensibly huge ways that this is a no-brainer. Also, Miles (and nobody else here) seems to realize that he's not actually saving his dad...by stopping The Spot from killing his dad he may very well guarantee that the whole universe dies (the one where his dad dies with it, and even his mom too, lol!) so he's literally doing nothing actually. Don't know the name of this trope, but it needs to die already."
1,6,Damn not as good as the first.
1,21,Fucking cliffhanger ending!?!?!ugh. it better not be 4 years till the next one is out.
1,9,They really goofed putting their teenage new recruit in charge of a clearly anomaly-introducing villain. Cmon guys.
1,7,"I’m getting real tired of these cliff hanger endings. I don’t mind multi part stories but don’t stop a movie mid fight like fast x. Each lord of the ring movie or Star Wars movie had a beginning, middle and end. This Spider-Man had no end."
1,7,"This movie kinda ruins the principles of Spider-Man. Spider-Man is meant to be someone that tries and save everyone no matter the consequences. But then we see a group of Spider-Man that we do know( Insomniac, Spectacular, the gang from the previous movie) and they just let people die cause they ‘have to’. And they’re all ok with it( I mean they got some slight conflicting feelings but they do it and do it often) but it’s a good movie I just hope the next movie we see miles be a bit more aggressive to them and call their actions out and they don’t make a joke about it."
1,8,Just finished watching it. I liked it overall but it got to be too much in some places. Just so jarring and sporadic. And the ending really came out of nowhere. What’s the third movie going to be?Also I’m pretty much multiversed out after this.
1,9,The movie was too ADHD for me. They tried to cram 10 jokes into 10 seconds and there was just too much going on. I didn't like it as much as the first one.
1,14,When Sony make so much better movies about multiverse than Marvel Studios...
1,12,This movie kind of goes to show how little cultural impact Tom Holland's Spider-Man has actually had. I think I maybe picked up one subtle reference (the Spider-Man training to hold two pieces of metal together a la the ferry in Homecoming that everyone used as a bridge).
1,9,It was good but this one will prob end up as my least favorite in the trilogy. It doesnt really have any rewatch value until the 3rd comes out.
1,22,the writers/directors actually talked to Karan Sonion authentasising niche inside jokes from indian culture[clip here](https://youtu.be/XHLrJSqZd48?t=106)& thats what makes this elite moviemaking !!inclusivity in the writers room <3
1,24,It's shit
1,11,I might’ve shit my pants when it was revealed Miles was in the wrong universe.
1,16,"General coming out and found family vibes plus ""Protect Trans Kids"" made for a great start to pride month! Really enjoyed this one and thought it was better than the first. Felt it got a bit long after the train scene but they had to set up part 3. Beautiful movie in IMAX!"
1,5,I’m way more worried about Miles’s mom than I am his dad
1,5,"Everyone be talking about Hobie which is fair but goddamn Pavitr Prabhakar stole the entire show for me. When I was walking home after the film all I could think about was the sounds and colours of Mumbaihattan, he's just so fun and talky and witty and his design looks fucking sick. I was so sad he wasn't as featured going on, but...Not as sad as the noticeable lack of a certain emissary from hell :("
1,5,"Did anyone else think the scene where Gwen and Miles keep thinking ""Shoot' while watching the hologram showing how Spot gained further powers was an homage to the famous scene in[ the Wire where the two detectives work a crime scene and only say ""fuck""?](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3n34oj)"
1,5,"I watched this movie in motion activated seats, and the cold open with Gwen ramping up the intensity on the drums was incredible. Each time she slammed the drums, the seat shook in response. The audio of her monologue and the imagery on the screen paired with the motion from the seats made for a unforgettably gripping intro. And that was just the first 3 minutes."
1,5,I’m sorry but this may be the greatest movie I’ve ever seen
1,5,I did not realise this movie was a two parter. I just feel a bit annoyed. Great movie. I wanted a conclusion though.
1,6,"Loved the movie, but a minor criticism: it felt kind of unbelievable that Miles managed to evade what appeared to be literally hundreds of Spider-People, many of whom are surely far more experienced than him, for so long, and in territory they’re all familiar with. The whole chase scene was incredibly cool and emotionally resonant, so I don’t care that much, but it felt a bit odd."
1,5,IT'S SO QUEER
0,5,Has anyone else noticed The Spot’s real name? Dr Johnathan Ohnn. “JOHNNY ON THE SPOT”
1,6,"We have to see **Supaidaman** in Beyond, right? They pretty much teased/confirmed it. Was totally expecting him to appear in ATSV."
1,6,"When the ""to be continued"" showed on screen, someone yelled ""WHAT THE FUCK?!"" And the entire theater erupted with laughter and shock This was the most ambitious animated film I've ever seen! The amount of pure artistic style and passion poured into it blew me away"
1,5,Saw it two times. Noticed the second time that Miguel is inserting spider venom in his bloodstream.Makes you think if he really is Spiderman. Also i miss the Stan Lee cameo so much
1,5,"Rio,  Miles mom was the hottest in the film. Do y'all think Arron was with 42 Miles mom?"
1,10,So am I crazy or was this the best spiderman movie ever half made?
1,8,"I feel like I'm the only one who is holding back a rating or review until this story is complete.  I guess one could argue, if this was a TV series, one would rate each episode.  But this movie didn't make an attempt at telling you this was going to be multiple movies.  I heard that in some news articles a few years ago, it was mentioned but that's a long time ago and it wasn't highly advertised.  I wish movies just put a Part 1 or Volume 1 at the beginning so we know what we're in for.  I have that feeling lied to feeling atm.I blame Matrix Reloaded for the trend/cash grab.  I think others are saying this is like Empire Strikes Back.  I also heard Dune at least put a Part 1 in their movie.Great movie though.  Except the ending.  Cliffhanger was a bit melodramatic for my taste."
1,5,"The slow start bored me, but luckily it got A LOT better. I loved it and i'm pissed off i have to wait 10 more months for the ending (i wasn't aware it was split in 2 parts)"
1,6,It’s pacing wasnt the best. The beginning (before miles goes through the portal) went on for so long. The chase scene >!(the one with the spider-men)!< felt like it lasted forever too.
1,8,"I wish I had been warned about all the flashing lights and overly bright colors/quick image shifts.  I love Miles Morales story line, everything MCU, and Spider-Man.  But I was sick as a dog after the movie with a blistering migraine and almost vomiting.  I had to go to bed which I never do!  I don’t have epilepsy or any other disorders except I do get motion sickness.  I wish the studio had not used so many visual effects.  I could not even watch the movie hardly, just peeking at times.  Thank goodness for Reddit and videos that break down the movie so I can listen to the plot line and the things I just could not watch."
1,6,"I don't know if I'm misinterpreting it, but I kind of fundamentally disagree with the core conflict of the movie.Miguel wants to ensure that Miles' father dies, as per it being a canon event. Miguel accepts the fact that Spider-Man always loses someone close to him, and it should always happen no matter how bad it is. Otherwise the multiverse will unravel and everyone will die.Obviously, Miles doesn't want that to happen and believes that it's possible to save both his father and the multiverse. Thus Miles attempts to do that.And what Miles is doing is *the most Spider-Man choice* to ever be made. So I don't understand how Miguel or literally every other Spider-Man in the multiverse doesn't understand where Miles is coming from. Every single Spider-Man should try and save everyone possible, because that's what Spider-Man does. Even if that attempt is in vain, Spider-Man wouldn't care and he would try anyways.It honestly really took me out of the movie, so can someone explain to me why my reasoning is wrong?"
1,7,Not having a conclusion killed this movie for me ngl. Like I’m legit frustrated by it one of the worst endings in recent films.
1,6,"This film is nothing short of outstanding, spectacular, amazing etc. You name it.But for me personally, it pales in comparison to the second one. The  first one is ingrained in my soul. This one is just not as good as ITSV."
1,6,"Idk, I didn’t like this movie personally. Loved the first one though. I just cant share the excitement with this one"
1,5,Movie felt too long. Art was great
1,5,Ending was very meh for me...I honestly hate when movies do a cut off ending like that; nephew was pretty disappointed too. Kept asking when the movie was actually gonna finish - and I don't really see how they have another movie's worth of stuff to do
1,5,"Man I am going to be in the minority but I really dont like the slow pacing at times, and how the movie can't stand on its own, It just feels weak to me, especially when we know most of the payoff. I really loved the rest of it, but it didn't feel like an actual movie more than half of a season of a show."
1,5,So was I supposed to know this was a part 1.  That ending was jarring
1,6,"I am very conflicted about this movie.On the one hand, I agree with what most people have already said: the animation is beautiful, the jokes land, Hobie is great, etc.On the other...1. Gwen, Peter B, and Peni (not to mention Spectacular Spider-Man) joining up with Miguel seemed VERY out of character for them. Actually, the fact that Miguel had so many allies at all just didn't make sense to me. Miguel really has no concrete proof that him living in another universe caused that universe to collapse. I just can't see most Spider-people, who tend to be scientifically inclined, believing the theory of one guy based on one incident. That's bad science. The only Spider-people I could see allying with him are young, relatively inexperienced ones who had just been through one of the ""canon"" events where they lost a loved one, and whose grief was clouding their senses. Miguel's theory would at least make their losses mean something in their eyes.2. I just can't believe that after everything Miles has been through with Peter B and Gwen, that they would keep so much from him and think that his father dying is the right thing, and that Gwen was willing to let her own father die. It bothered me so much that I'm seriously on the fence about whether or not that ruined their characters for me.3. There were references that you wouldn't understand if you hadn't seen the latest live-action Marvel movies from the MCU and Sony. I know the Spiderverse movies are a celebration of Spider-Man and all his incarnations, but to me, they're also a celebration of animation and its various styles, and giving screen time to live-action characters, however brief, felt like an insult. We already got Tobey and Andrew in No Way Home; we don't need to see them here. I'm praying that they and Tom don't show up in the sequel. 4. Why in god's name did they have Jessica Drew participate in fight scenes while she was pregnant? Does Miguel not allow maternity leave or what? Working while pregnant is one thing, but if your work is inherently dangerous, then doing so puts your baby in harm's way. I just can't believe that no one on the writing team thought that was a bad idea."
1,6,"Visually it's a mess compared to the first one. Felt like every shot had 30 different things going on, it gets genuinely exhausting after a while."
1,5,"Obviously the animation is beautiful, but man by the end of this it felt like I watched the first act of a movie. I couldn’t believe that was it. And did anyone else keep getting that “this is the end of the movie” feeling multiple times during the last 20 minutes? Scene that ends in swelling music, than another scene that ends in swelling music, than another scene that ends in swelling music. Jesus. Idk the first movie is masterpiece to me but this is the most incomplete part 1 I’ve ever watched. Also where the hell was supaidaman? I thought I read a while ago that he was supposed to be in this"
1,6,Movie sucks.In that it was too short.
1,18,This is peak cinema. What a time to be a Spiderman fan
1,15,"#**A master class in story telling and animation, once again.**How do you follow up one of the most when’re defining, character defining animated films of the last decade?Somehow they did it. You care about the characters behind the mask, their plights, give them more depth, and elevate the personal stakes. Despite being a fantastical setting, everything feels personal, real, and relatable. Banger soundtrack, banger animation, the perfect amount of Spidey fan service. Goddamn. They did it again folks. Us Spidey fans are eating good again with the PS5 game too!Fuck, I love this movie."
1,5,I guess I'm ADD or whatever because I didn't have any trouble keeping up with the fast paced animation. The story made little sense though. Miguel is basically Spider Thanos and all the other spidermen instantly back him up? I don't think so. They're trying to shoehorn in Infinity War where it isn't necessary. How about making Spot the sole threat? He's more than enough to justify multiverse collapse.Also the final twist really undermines the point that you choose your own fate. Apparently the only thing separating hero Miles from villain Miles is whether or not his uncle or father dies first.
1,5,"I personally still love the movie, (9/10) but I'm surprised that so many people are saying it's better than the first. I think there's clear things it did worse and it did better.I think the parental relationship, animation and the dialogue during the slow scenes is much better, as is the villain. However, I think the one-liner quips is way more annoying and the humor is worse if at best on par with the first one. I think the pacing is worse too, I feel many scenes could've been shortened or cut and you actually could've had a final act instead of a cliffhanger by chopping off some scenes and making it 20 minute longer or something. I would've liked to see added scenes (like maybe Miles actually having a reaction to seeing his friends again) instead of seeing others.Overall, I feel the movie has less emotion than the first one does. Uncle Aaron dying in Into The Spiderverse actually got something out of me, but I don't feel any very emotional scenes in this movie. I think the Gwen plotline with her dad is adequate, but it's no where near an emotional kick that the first one gives with Prowlers death. And though it may just be because the movie hasn't lasted in my memory enough, I think scenes overall are less impactful and memorable. You don't have a scene like Miles jumping off the building in the first one. I think the ending is also a poor thing, I'm surprised that I don't see more people take issue with it as I think the ending is very akin to Dune: Part One which many people had issues with.  (Dune does still have a worse ending though).It may sound like I hate the movie, but it's still a great movie but I'm very surprised at the amount of people saying it's better than the first. I think it's a combination of a bit of recency bias and people not seeing the first in a while."
1,5,Okay I loved the movie but as somebody that went completely blind into it... man that cliffhanger ending was disappointing to say the least.
1,5,My second watch.My daughter (5) loved it loved it loved it. She did not move or talk or ask to go to the restroom. My oldest had seen it once before so was background spotting. My wife really like it and had lots of spidergwen questions.  She wants to wait two weeks and go see it again. The teenage gaggle of girls behind us really liked and and let out a huge moan with to be continued. But several if them were saying it was their favorite movie in a long time.The 26ish dude behind me said he gave it a 6.5 but he came to see a whole movie. His gf said she really liked and was gonna bring her little brother.  The large family behind us were all into it. The youngest put the first spiderverse movie on his moms phone as we walked out
1,5,"I didn't care for it.  It started out well, but turned dull and predictable.  It was at least a half hour too long which led to pacing issues.  Definitely worse than the first, but that wasn't all that good, either.  I liked the music that started it during Gwen's narration.  Was that the score?"
1,8,"What a fucking movie, 10/10 imo.I never felt bored, I never felt like it was long.I got more Gwen than I thought.This was a good set up movie, and the third movie will be fantastic. Sometimes the sequel movies are just tunneling on the romantic aspect of the characters, but this one was a good dynamic since it caused a rift between the romantic pair.MCU PLEASE give me another Multiverse  movie, do I really have to wait until the next Avengers movie, or DeadPool 3 for this? Movie not show people."
1,8,That was one of the best theatrical experiences I've ever had watching anything Spider-Man related. Oh my god
1,5,Calling it a cliffhanger ending is doing such a disservice to the layers of reveals we were handed at the end imo.
0,8,Does anyone else dare to call it the best Spider-Man movie ever?
1,6,"For me I was going into this expecting the Scarlet Spider to have a decent part but they made him a dumb comic relief character. They could have utilised his back story for depth giving these canon events he could have been a juxtaposition with a unique, alternate viewpoint given his tragic story. Surely the clone saga would’ve been a canon event or an anomaly so 2099 could’ve had beef with that. I wanted Ben to get some justice after recent comic runs like chasm but it was wishful thinking. It’s such a shame because his design was so clean and the art style was nailed it’s so sad that this was all for nothing. I enjoyed the cameos, there were several to enjoy my favourite was Spectacular Spider-Man that made me hope we could get Christopher Daniel Barnes Spidey in the next movie.  As another commenter said on another thread the characterisation of Miguel felt more apt for someone like Superior Spidey. Also the characterisation of every other Spidey that you know and love who was featured in the movie who agreed with Miguel’s faction was character assassinated as this is something I don’t think any Spidey would get behind especially the way it’s being done.  My absolute favourite thing about the movie was the art style for Gwen’s world it’s straight from the Spidergwen comics with the colourisation and the watercolours. I also liked her suit update and Miles suit looked sleek too. The way they also incorporated some comic panels, movie events and video game scenes in the explanation of canon events was so cool too. Hobie Spidey was a good addition and a fun character with a few good one liners. Pavitr from what we seen of him was pretty cool and I enjoyed the scenes in his universe. Overall I think the plot could’ve been worked on and would’ve preferred something like the comics Spiderverse storyline with all the Spiders working together to defeat a threat instead of putting a couple of Spidey’s down to raise up Miles and Gwen up. I felt we spent too long with Miles and his parents too. The scene at the party was a bit boring I felt we accomplished everything we needed to understand about the dynamic at the school meeting and when Miles Spidey talks to his Father after chasing the Spot."
1,6,"This was the best movie I HAVE EVER SEEN. The first one used to be that, but this one somehow tops it in every way. I love the emotions throughout the movie. ITSV focused more on becoming Spider-Man and learning how to be one, whereas this one emphasized all the problems that come with being Spider-Man and the loneliness that Miles and Gwen go through. They're honestly some of, if not the only characters that I sympathize that much with. Their lives are hard and not really fun. Seeing each other is the only thing that keeps them going, but they know (especially Gwen) they can't do that. They have to keep their distance from one another. The music vid for 'calling' only makes it so much worse. EVERY LINE in that song talks about their situation. It's been almost a week since I've seen the movie and I still can't get over it. It honestly hurts and I'm not even the most sympathetic person out there. &#x200B;I haven't even gotten to the visuals, album, villains, rest of the plot. But just seeing both Miles and Gwen going through it like that makes this movie a 10/10. The colors in Gwen's world really showed her pain and seeing her problems with her dad made it so painful. &#x200B;If anyone is interested, [I did a more detailed breakdown of the greatness of this movie](https://twitter.com/FeliciaWRLD/status/1665151318208532480?s=20) as I just couldn't get over it."
1,5,"I've never actively wanted a film to never end more than I have now.Holy fucking shit, they were not fucking kidding when they said this was one of the best Spider-Man movies ever"
1,5,"The “Empire Strikes Back” of animated comic book films. The conclusion, “Beyond the Spider-Verse” is going to wipe the floor with whatever competition it has the year it releases. I think any film studio backing the Superhero genre should concede to the Spider-Verse films and make them exclusively animated from here on out because I don’t know of any “Comic-Book” film so captures the essence of the “Book” portion of that phrase than these films (maybe Sin City?). I was fully prepared to stick around for four hours or so before that whammy of a cliffhanger."
1,7,Absolute freaking masterpiece
1,6,This movie is the Empire Strikes Back for the next generation
