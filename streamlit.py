Seeing aged-up Peni Parker in her upgraded mech for the first time almost made me tear up a bit.Oh yeah and Hailee Steinfeld deserves an Oscar for her performance here, all of the scenes when she's paired up with her dad were beautifully executed. Easily the best parts of the film for me personally.")
